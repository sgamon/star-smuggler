# Star Smuggler

## INSTRUCTIONS
In this game you are “Duke” Springer, star smuggler and rogue-about-the-galaxy.
On your Antelope-class ship you travel about the Pavonis sector in search of
wealth, and probably one step ahead of both your creditors and the police! In
this game you play alone, against the game itself, trying to survive and
become successful. The rules booklet is divided into sections, each of which
is numbered (<a href="#R000">R000</a> numbers), while the events booklet has numbered events
paragraphs (<a href="#E000">E000</a> numbers).

You can learn this game as you play. Simply start with the first event (<a href="#E001">E001</a>
and then read sections as necessary. You may find it convenient to read
important rules sections first, including (<a href="#R203">R203</a>), (<a href="#R212">R212</a>), (<a href="#R221">R221</a>), (<a href="#R230">R230</a>) and
(<a href="#<a href="#R232">R232</a>">R232</a>), or if ambitious, read all the rules sections first (<a href="#R201">R201</a>-R232).

A pencil and some paper is needed for this game — to keep track of your
possessions, current situation, special events, etc. You may even wish to
record enough detail to provide a “personal history” of what happens to you in
the game.

## HOW TO PLAY
Star Smuggler is a realistic solitaire adventure game. You play the game hour
by hour, 10 hours of activity each day, and ten (10) days to the week. Each
hour you decide whether you’ll travel somewhere new, or stay in place and try
to make a contact. Sometimes travel or a contact takes more than one hour. In
either case, travel or contact will lead to the encounter tables, and an event
will occur. You can spend an entire day just sitting in place resting,
recuperating, repairing equipment, etc. At the end of each day equipment
break-down is checked, and salaries to your crewmen or other hirelings may be
due. At the end of each 10-day week loan payments on your starship are due.

Your objective is to make your fortune, which means paying off the loan for
your starship, and hopefully making a few million besides! However, just
staying alive and free is difficult enough in the dangerous worlds of the
future!

## DIE ROLLS
When a die (singular of dice) roll is required, the rules often indicate this
by “1d6” — meaning one die is rolled, or “2d6” — meaning two dice are rolled
and totaled. Sometimes an amount is added or subtracted to the roll (or total
in the case of 2d6). This is indicated by a “+” or “-” sign and the amount.
For example, “1d6+1” indicates a roll of one die, with one added afterward.

## ABOUT THE GAME
Star Smuggler is a complex game. It is an entire role-playing experience which
you conduct alone. In fact, Game-masters of science fiction role-playing
systems may wish to use this as an adventure or campaign guideline (with
appropriate rules adjustments to suit their own RPG system). However, this
game can be played many times, with many different results. Furthermore, the
planets in the sector, and their attributes, can be changed from game to game
for even greater variation.

## GAME EQUIPMENT
Star Smuggler includes this instruction booklet, a separate events booklet, a
sheet of twelve planetary titles (one of which is asteroids) to be assembled
in various ways (see <a href="#R207">R207</a>). and two dice. The box corner tabs include cut-out
markers of Duke Springer, his spaceship, its boat, and a typical skimmer,
which may be useful in the game as markers. The planetary tiles each have an
identification letter (A through K), and two are placed together to form a
circular planet. Which tiles are used for which planets is given in the Guide
to the Pavonis Sector (<a href="#R207">R207</a>).

## <a name="R201">R201 Characters</a>
Each character in the game has three ratings: Marksmanship (“M”), Hand-to-Hand
fighting (“H”), and Endurance (“E”). Each is rated numerically, with higher
numbers superior. Characters may also have skills, such as pilot/navigator,
gunner, medic, driver, etc. Characters may possess certain items of equipment,
whose quality depends on the “Tech Code” (technology level), or other items of
worth, whose value depends on where they are bought and sold.

The characters include yourself, the Star Smuggler Duke Springer (see <a href="#R201">R201</a>B),
any followers in your crew or party, and any other characters, creatures, or
robots encountered during the game. Characters can be friendly or hostile,
intelligent or unintelligent.

When a character joins your party, note his (or her) vital statistics as
needed. You can voluntarily dismiss or abandon members of your party if you
wish (sometimes expedient when making an escape, or if money or equipment runs
short). Dismissal or abandonment may have penalties to you (<a href="#R220">R220</a>B). Characters
encountered who don’t join your party can be ignored after the event, they
simply go on their way, and “disappear” from the game.

To determine your own personal characteristics at the start of the game,
see <a href="#R201">R201</a>B.

### <a name="R201">Characteristics and Skills (R201A):</a>
Marksmanship measures your ability to fire all ranged weapons (sidearms,
skimmer guns, etc.) except starship guns (which require a special skill
instead). The higher your rating, the better you shoot. Ratings range from 0
to 6, if none is given, assume a 0 rating. See <a href="#R230">R230</a>D for rules on firing
ranged weapons.

Hand-to-hand measures your ability in close combat. The higher your rating, the
better. Ratings range from 0 to 6. This handto-hand rating also determines
defense against such attacks, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>G for details.

Endurance value is a measure of how much damage you can take in combat, and
still survive. See <a href="#R231">R231</a> for detailed rules about wounds.

### <a name="R201">Your Character — Duke Springer (R201B):</a>
You begin play as the star smuggler, Duke Springer, a talented and experienced
starship pilot who is having trouble being successful in legal commercial
enterprises. You have a starship (Antelope-class), a speedy and versatile
small merchant vessel that can be operated by just one person, a
pilot-navigator like yourself. In addition, you are a qualified starship
gunner (can operate the guns of your ship), but the guns are only Tech Code 1
(low quality). You are an excellent shot with smaller weapons, with a
marksmanship of 5. After a rough-and-tumble life in many spaceports, bars, and
back alleys your hand-tohand combat is even better, with a rating of 6, Coming
from a high-gravity home planet, and because of your life, your body is in
excellent condition, your endurance value is 10. In addition to these
characters, you have a Cunning rating (<a href="#R202">R202</a>) which other characters do not.
See <a href="#E001">E001</a> for complete details of your possessions at the start of the game.

## <a name="R202">R202 Cunning</a>
Cunning is an ability that combines smooth talking, staying cool, thinking fast
in an emergency, rapidly figuring alternatives when a plan is blocked, and
generally outsmarting your adversaries. Duke Springer is the only character
with a Cunning rating. The first time you play, roll 1d6 (one die) to obtain
your rating. If you have played before, you can adjust your Cunning by one in
each subsequent game. If you found the game too difficult, or if you lost,
increase your Cunning by one (+1). If you wish more challenge, or if you won,
reduce your Cunning by one (-1). When you feel you have become an expert,
trying playing with a Cunning rating of 0! When an event calls for a “Cunning
roll,” you roll one die and must get less than or equal to your Cunning rating
to succeed, unless some other requirement is indicated.

## <a name="R203">R203 Daily Actions</a>
At the start of each day, you either perform normal travel and contact, or stay
in place for RRR (Rest, Recuperation and Repair). At the end of each day, you
must check for breakdowns of equipment, and after each 10-day week, make
payments on your loan. Each is explained in detail below. Time: each day has
ten (10) hours for activity. All events are timed in hours, or sometimes take
the rest of the day. If an event goes over the normal limit, you automatically
get extra hours that day to finish it (an event will not carry over to the
next day). Any other people in your party either travel with you, or stay
behind doing little (see <a href="#R220">R220</a> for details).

### <a name="R203">Travel (R203A)</a>
During a normal day of travel and contact, you may travel about the land area
(<a href="#R204">R204</a>G). You have the following travel options, provided the vehicle is
present and available:

1. Walk on foot: travel one land step per day, or spend an hour to move to an adjacent (connected by triple line) area
1. Hire a commercial land vehicle: one hour per land step, see <a href="#R215">R215</a>.
1. Drive a skimmer: if you own one, one hour per step, see <a href="#R215">R215</a>.
1. Fly the Ship’s Boat: 1/10 hour per step, 1 hour to go to or from orbit/space station, see <a href="#R214">R214</a> for details.
1. Take the Orbital Shuttle: 1 hour to or from space station or spaceport, see <a href="#R215">R215</a> for details.
1. Pilot Starship: 1/10 hour per step, 1 hour to or from orbit/space station, can also travel between planets (<a href="#<a href="#R212">R212</a>">R212</a>F-g) and between star systems (R212A-d).

When you travel, each new area entered requires a check for detection, with an
entry event if detection occurs, see <a href="#R225">R225</a> for complete rules. You can travel
more than once per day, provided you have sufficient hours left for the next
travel, and you have sufficient fuel (<a href="#R211">R211</a>) and life support (<a href="#R213">R213</a>) where
necessary. You may alternate travel and contact activities in the same day,
provided sufficient time remains.

### <a name="R203">Contact (R203B)</a>
During a day of travel and contact, you may attempt to make contacts. See <a href="#R227">R227</a>
for details and procedure. Basically, in a contact try you consult the Entry &
Contact Table (<a href="#R233">R233</a>) for the result, so it may take many attempts before you
find what you are seeking (i.e., get the desired result).

### <a name="R203">RRR — Rest, Recuperation & Repair (R203C)</a>
This action is allowed only if you spend a full day (all 10 hours) doing it. No
travel and no contact is allowed during an RRR day.

At the start of an RRR day, first determine if an unwanted contact occurs (see
<a href="#R227">R227</a>A). If nothing happens, you can spend the day repairing equipment (<a href="#R219">R219</a>)
or healing (<a href="#R231">R231</a>). A character cannot heal and repair at the same time, but
some in your party could be healing while others are involved in repair work.
If a repairman or mobile repairman is needed, you must have already arranged
to have him (or it) present during the RRR day — searching for repairmen is
not part of RRR.

### <a name="R203">Breakdown (R203D)</a>
At the end of each day, any vehicle or piece of equipment you used may break
down. Consult <a href="#<a href="#R218">R218</a>">R218</a> for details. Preventive maintenance (R218B) avoids the
danger of breakdown. Breakdown need not be checked for vehicles that didn’t
move (even if providing life support and/or communications), or for starships
and boats in orbit or docked at a space station. Breakdown of individual items
(such as weapons) is separate from any vehicle carrying them, or any other
device.

### <a name="R203">Loan Payments (R203E)</a>
At the end of each 10-day week, a loan payment is due on your Antelope-class
starship. The ship originally cost 120,000 Secs (Sector Exchange Units, the
“money” used here, see <a href="#R232">R232</a>A), and your loan for this amount is 300 S interest
due each 10-day week. In addition to interest, you can also pay back any part
of the principal (the original 120,000 S) as well. Interest payments do not
reduce the principal, and even if you pay some of the principal, interest
continues at 300 S per 10-day until the full principal is paid.

If you default on your loan (fail to pay interest) you have 30 days (three
10-day weeks) to pay the entire principal, after which the loan company begins
attempts to repossess the ship (and appropriate events begin occurring!). Once
you miss a payment, you can’t make up with just that payment — the whole loan
becomes due (the loan company are “sharks” — who else would loan you so much?).

Incidentally, half the principal (60,000 S) is due ten years hence, and the
rest of the principal (another 60,000 S) is due twenty years hence, but it’s
unlikely you’ll play long enough to worry about this! Using banks to hold some
of your money, you can have loan payments made from your account (in case you
aren’t around a place with banks when the week is up). See <a href="#R232">R232</a>A for details.

### <a name="R203">Victory / Defeat (R203F)</a>
An overwhelming victory in this game is paying off your entire spaceship loan
of 120,000 S, and have a substantial fortune left for high living (how much
left determines the degree of victory you can keep on looking for more
endlessly!). However, staying alive and in possession of your spaceship for as
long as possible is the real key to success. “Duke” Springer likes the freedom
of the spaceways. Losing his ship or his personal freedom is a fate almost
worse than death. Of course, even if you are imprisoned, or trapped in a
stasis box, you can still hope to keep enough wealth to buy a ship, or
otherwise get back into the star faring life again. The only true defeat in
the game is death. Actually, the process of playing the game is designed to be
sufficient enjoyment unto itself – how well can you survive as a
roughand-tumble free booting captain of the spaceways?

## <a name="R204">R204 Maps / Classifications</a>
Star Smuggler is set in the Pavonis Sector, a distant star region with ten
inhabited star systems. Various classifications and codes are used for each
system, and a unique mapping system for the various planets. The standard
description of the sector is in <a href="#R207">R207</a>, but variants and modifications are
possible (<a href="#R208">R208</a> & <a href="#R209">R209</a>).

### <a name="R204">System Characteristics (R204A)</a>
Each star system has a wealth code, a technology (tech) code, and one or more
planets, perhaps with a separate asteroid belt as well. Planets have varying
tile layouts, gravity, atmosphere.

### <a name="R204">Wealth Code (R204B)</a>
This code ranges from 0 to 100, and represents the general level of wealth and
economic strength of the system. Generally, in wealthy systems things cost
more, while in poorer systems things cost less. However, a high wealth code
system could still have numerous slums, with many discontents dwelling in
utter poverty. Costs for goods and services will vary with the wealth code;
often a cost multiplier is used after consulting the base price table (<a href="#R241">R241</a>).

### <a name="R204">Tech Code (R204C)</a>
This code ranges from 0 to 100, and represents the sophistication of equipment
in use. Although all equipment is futuristic, high tech items work better, and
are more powerful, than lower tech, but tend to break down more often. Often
high tech items bring good prices on low tech worlds, although it may be
illegal to introduce such equipment for sale on certain worlds. Technology has
important effects on weaponry (<a href="#R216">R216</a>) and on breakdown (<a href="#R218">R218</a>).

### <a name="R204">Planetary Characteristics (R204D)</a>
Within each system, each planet has various characteristics. This includes the
two map tiles used to form the planet, its gravity, and atmosphere. All
planets within a star system have the same political structure, and are in
constant communication. Travel in orbits, or from one planet to another
(within the system) is not normally regulated or supervised carefully —
planetary governments concentrate their interest on ships arriving from
hyperspace, and at the various spaceports and stations.

### <a name="R204">Gravity (R204E)</a>
The gravity factor of a planet varies from 1 to 16, the higher number
indicating a stronger pull. A gravity of 10 or more prevents a ship’s boat
from climbing to orbit (it lacks sufficient fuel and power), although the boat
could descend from orbit, or move about on the surface. Asteroids and space
stations have a gravity factor of 0, as do ships in orbit, although spin and
small accelerations, or the minor mass of the asteroid, provide a light
gravity effect on people and items.

### <a name="R204">Atmosphere (R204F)</a>
A planet’s atmosphere is rated as “good,” “bad” or “no” air. Regardless of
planet atmosphere, land areas with white letters as their title all have good
air (on bad or no air planets, they have domes or force screens). In bad or no
air (black labeled areas on planets of that type) you need life support to
survive (<a href="#R213">R213</a>). In bad air, normal skimmers will not function — their
air-breathing engines automatically and instantly break down. A skimmer
purchased on a bad air world will work on that world (due to special engine
modifications), but won’t work on any other bad air world, nor on a world with
good air. No skimmer can function in “no air.” No air also prevents starships
and ship’s boat from making a powerless glide landing; instead, a powered
landing is needed (which uses fuel).

### <a name="R204">Land Areas (R204G)</a>
Each planet is composed of two map tiles, joined in a circular shape. The
planet has various colored symbols on it, each symbol is a “land area.” Each
symbol has a name indicating its type, and additional codes for special
facilities: Symbol Colors denote entrance restrictions:

1. White areas can be entered by any type of travel.
1. Yellow areas cannot be entered by a starship or ship’s boat, but any other form of travel is allowed.
1. Red areas can only be entered on foot or in a commercial vehicle, no other form of travel is allowed.
1. Purple areas only by starship, ship’s boat, or orbital shuttle.

Area Names in white denote good air within the area, area names in black denote
normal planetary air (which may be good, bad or none).

[b] after the name indicates banking facilities are present (see <a href="#R232">R232</a>A).

[m] after the name indicates medical facilities present (<a href="#R231">R231</a>C).

Area Connectors are lines that indicate travel routes. You move from area to
area along these lines:

*Short triple-line connector* indicates one hour of travel time, regardless of
the means used, to move to the other area. This symbol really indicates that
the areas are touching, and thus if both have good air in them, travel is
possible between without life support, even on a bad or no air planet.

*Long single line connectors* with a number indicate a larger distance. The
number is the distance in “land steps” between areas. See travel rules (<a href="#R203">R203</a>A)
for time needed to traverse a land step.

## <a name="R205">R205 Area Types</a>
There are sixteen different types of areas on planets, each with a different
map tile symbol. Sometimes a contact try (<a href="#R227">R227</a>) will reference one of the
paragraphs below, which simply means you roll 2d6 dice to determine which
occurs. When you get this result, you may keep rolling (spending the
appropriate number of hours for each roll, as indicated) as long as you like,
including to the next day and beyond. Some results indicate “no more rolls”
which means a new contract try and the appropriate paragraph reference is
needed to start again.

Once you finish with the roll(s) in the appropriate paragraph below, and do
anything else, you cannot return to that paragraph unless a new contact try
(<a href="#R227">R227</a>) again results in that paragraph. This system may seem peculiar, but it
represents the difficulty of dealing with local directories, languages,
communication problems, and the fact that the items or services you desire may
be rare, already “booked up” for a period, etc.

### <a name="R205">City (R205A)</a>
An extensive built-up area with a large population. There are many
opportunities to buy and sell items. Banking and medical centers are present.
Each roll takes one hour, roll two dice (2d6):

| 2D6 | Result                      |
|-----|-----------------------------|
|  2  | hire bodyguard (<a href="#E063">E063</a>)       |

|  6  | hire repairman (<a href="#E060">E060</a>)       |
|  7  | fuel units (<a href="#E026">E026</a>)           |
|  8  | commercial transport (<a href="#E074">E074</a>) |
|  9  | life support units (<a href="#E029">E029</a>)   |
| 10  | skimmer (<a href="#E032">E032</a>)              |
| 11  | hire driver (<a href="#E062">E062</a>)          |
| 12  | hire medic (<a href="#E065">E065</a>)           |

### <a name="R205">Colony (R205B)</a>
A residence outpost on a planet, it can supply nearly every need of the
colonists that live on planet. It is very difficult for an outsider to pass
without notice in a colony. Banks and medical centers are present. Each roll
takes one hour, roll two dice (2d6):

| 2D6 | Result                                                                 |

Military bases and installations have tight security and are generally risky to
penetrate. If you can make contact, you may be able to buy military weaponry.
Banking facilities are available inside the base, but medical are not (the
military send all nonmilitary personnel to civilian hospitals!). Each roll
takes four hours; roll one die (1d6):

### <a name="R205">Palace (R205H)</a>
This is the extensive and elaborate lodging of the royal or political family in
power on the planet. There are no items or services regularly for sale, so no
dice rolls are given. All contact results in special events. As you might
imagine, palaces are normally well guarded.

### <a name="R205">Prison (R205I)</a>
The area for storage of criminals and other enemies of society. A prison is
normally easier to enter than to leave. Prisoners with life sentences are
normally packed into 1 CU Stasis Units (<a href="#R212">R212</a>E), to save on food and guard
requirements. As a result, stasis units of 1 and 2 CU are in common use,
including some buying and selling. Each roll takes two hours, roll one die
(1d6):

the planetary code, whichever is less); ignore purchase prices, all found
equipment is free. Each roll takes five hours; roll two dice (2d6):

| 2D6 | Result                                                                 |

### <a name="R205">Scientific (R205M)</a>
An area where scientific research and development is performed. Items purchased
here are considered one tech level higher than normal (after tech code and
normal die roll determines tech level). If an item from here breaks down, it
must be returned to this area on this planet for repair, or repaired by an
engineer you hired from here. Banking facilities are present. Each roll takes
one hour; roll two dice (2d6):

## <a name="R206">R206 Asteroids</a>
One game tile represents an asteroid belt, rather than half a planetary
surface. There are six asteroids shown on the title, plus a space station. Of
course, there are many more than six asteroids in the belt, this is a
simplification for game purposes. The asteroid belt is an ideal place to store
or hide materials, and occasional finds of value do occur.

Asteroids have a gravity factor of 0 (although they actually have a very light
pull). Asteroids have no air, nor atmosphere. No goods or services may be
bought at the asteroids, but normal activities and contact tries are possible
at the space station (see <a href="#R205">R205</a>P). The dashed line for the orbit represents
ships in the asteroid belt neither at an asteroid, nor docked at the space
station.

The connecting lines from asteroids to orbit represent the fact that all
asteroids and the station connect to each other through the orbit. It takes
one hour to go from any asteroid or the station to orbit, and another hour to
go from orbit to any asteroid or the station (regardless of where one
started). This is the maximum speed for either a starship or the ship’s boat,
the only way to go to or from asteroids.

## <a name="R207">R207 Guide to the Pavonis Sector</a>
Ten star systems make up the Pavonis Sector, connected in pattern “one” (see
<a href="#R234">R234</a>). Complete data on each is provided below. Planets and asteroids are
listed with the closest one to the star (sun) of the system first, and given
the lowest number (i.e.. Planet I is closer than Planet II).

### <a name="R207">Regari (R207A)</a>
Once a key center of industrial development, Regari is now a hint of its past
glory. People live a poorer lifestyle, and the system has suffered a serious
economic depression for years. There is little system defense, and breakdown
of equipment is now commonplace.

### <a name="R207">Palatek (R207B)</a>
Palatek attempted to replace the technological preeminence of Regari, but went
to such extremes that toxic effluents poisoned the atmosphere. Despite
scientific efforts, respiratory diseases remain a common cause of death.
System defense is largely under corporate control, and emphasizes protection
against industrial espionage.

### <a name="R207">Byzantium (R207C)</a>
A very old society exists here, noted for its political intrigue and
complexity, its vigilant secret police, and underground dungeons that none are
said to leave. It is known as a dangerous system to enter, unless one has the
right connections.

### <a name="R207">Imperia (R207D)</a>
The self-declared capital of a modest empire that includes Palatek, Byzantium,
and Talitar. This system assumes the trappings of an imperial capital, but
without the actual power. Showy buildings and ornate artwork everywhere
conceal dire poverty and a mean existence. Imperia tends to waste its wealth
on efforts of size and spectacle rather than quality, although some families
possess valuable treasures.

### <a name="R207">Talitar (R207E)</a>
Noted for its vicious and repressive government. Talitarians have few freedoms;
the army is in firm control, and troopers vigorously patrol both the planets
and the space lanes of the system. Careful bribery can be useful here, but it
is exceedingly risky.

### <a name="R207">Cubro (R207F)</a>
This system has been a rich source of metals, semiconductors, and crystals for
centuries. Much of the planetary surface is now mined out, with extensive
wastelands, acid drainage, and mine tailings. There are still valuable mineral
finds, but they are relatively small, and depend more on luck than prospecting
skill. Cubro now has become a center of industrial development using
non-metallic materials, especially the still experimental “bio-plastic” alloys.

### <a name="R207">Uruskop (R207G)</a>
Throughout its long history, Uruskop has been very isolationist, having little
trade with other systems and developing in its own unique way. It now has a
moderately advanced technology, but its machines and devices tend to confuse
outsiders. Foreigners also tend to make social errors, which offend or anger
the residents. For these reasons, this system is avoided by wise travelers.

### <a name="R207">Nipna (R207H)</a>
This system seems to have a perpetual war with Mynkuria, with a history of
battles for at least a thousand years. The system is preoccupied with
developing its war machine, and attempts to annihilate life at Mynkuria. Nipna
uses the long-range strategy of high-technology weapons, especially due to its
population losses, and all industrial and scientific efforts are devoted to
armaments.

### <a name="R207">Mynkuria (R207I)</a>
This system seems to have a perpetual war with Nipna, with a history of battles
for at least one thousand years. The system is preoccupied with destroying
Nipna, with a long-range strategy centered on the fanatical dedication of its
warriors. It tends to base weapons and armament designs on captured Nipnan
equipment. Mynkurian troopers readily ignore wounds and pain, and are prepared
to spend their lives willingly to damage Nipna. Mynkuria also trains highly
efficient spies and saboteurs, notorious for their resistance to torture
(despite the advanced techniques used by both sides).

### <a name="R207">New Karma (R207J)</a>
This system emphasizes personal spiritual development over technology. There
has been an increase in mental powers, including psionic abilities. Many
unusual religious cults are centered here, as well as various arts and other
creative activities. Individuality is encouraged, so often what other systems
consider “insane” is, tolerated as normal. Unfortunately, the wars between
Nipna and Mynkuria have affected this system at times, so New Karma maintains
a military force with simple equipment, but a combat record of high
effectiveness. This is probably because talented psionicists are provided
complete freedom and great luxury while in military service.

## <a name="R208">R208 Random Star System Connections</a>
The connections between star systems may be varied. Instead of using the
standard connection pattern “one”, roll 1d6 and use the resulting pattern, as
shown in <a href="#R234">R234</a>. A line between two systems indicates they are one jump apart.

## <a name="R209">R209 Random Star System Design</a>
You may redesign any or all of the star systems. To create a new system,
roll 1d6 to determine the overall composition of the system:

|  D6 | Result                    |
|-----|---------------------------|
|  2  | hire repairman (<a href="#E060">E060</a>)     |
| 1-2 | one planet                |
|  3  | one planet and asteroids  |
| 4-5 | two planets               |
|  6  | two planets and asteroids |

Next shuffle together all the planetary tiles except asteroids, and randomly
draw two for the first planet, and if there is a second, draw two more. This
will alter the actual tiles for a planet.

To determine gravity, roll 3d6 and subtract two (3d6-2).

To determine atmosphere, roll 2d6:

| 2D6   | Result                    |
|-------|---------------------------|
|  2    | hire repairman (<a href="#E060">E060</a>)     |
| 2-3   | is no air                 |
| 4-9   | is good air               |
| 10-12 | is bad air                |

The designer recommends that other characteristics for a system remain
unchanged, including name, description, wealth, and tech codes. However, if
you wish to create new wealth and tech codes, a 2d6 roll can be used:

| 2D6 | Result                |
|-----|-----------------------|
|  2  | 0 (10 if a tech code) |
|  3  | 10                    |
|  4  | 15                    |
|  5  | 20                    |
|  6  | 25                    |
|  7  | 30                    |
|  8  | 40                    |
|  9  | 50                    |
| 10  | 60                    |
| 11  | 70                    |
| 12  | 100                   |

## <a name="R210">R210 Vehicles / Equipment</a>
There are various ways to travel, including on foot, and in various vehicles.
Vehicles include star ships, ship’s boats, orbital shuttles, commercial
vehicles, and skimmers. You also have access to a wide range of equipment,
including weapons (sidearms, heavy hand arms, skimmer guns, boat guns, and
starship guns), robots, utility suits, and other items.

Each item of equipment has a tech level ranging from 1 to 6. When you find,
purchase, or encounter someone using an item of equipment, refer to the Tech
Level of Equipment (<a href="#R235">R235</a>) table, roll 1d6, and cross-reference the tech code
of the system with the roll. The table indicates the item’s actual tech code,
from 1 to 6. As a result, the tech code of the system will generally suggest
tech levels of items, but the table result can vary the results.

Some Level of Equipment results show “*1” as the result. If you encounter an
individual with this result, they are unarmed, and any fight will be
hand-to-hand (<a href="#R230">R230</a>G); any other found or purchased equipment is considered
tech level 1.

Prices of equipment are noted in event paragraphs, when you have the
opportunity to buy or sell. Wealth code can affect prices, see <a href="#R229">R229</a>A. The
special costs associated with crewmen and other hirelings are noted in <a href="#R220">R220</a>,
and the special costs for your starship bank payments in <a href="#R203">R203</a>E.

## <a name="R211">R211 Capacity Units, Repair Units, Fuel Units</a>

### <a name="R211">Capacity Units (R211A)</a>
All available space on a starship and on other vehicles is measured in Capacity
Units (CUs). Most people and materials require CUs for storage and transport,
given in the description of the item (see <a href="#R236">R236</a> for reference). Unless
otherwise restricted, any type of space can be used for any type of material.
For example, you could have people in the Cargo Hold, weapons in the
Engineering space, extra Fuel Units in the Crew Quarters, etc. if you desired.
Due to the possibility of searches, theft, and damage it is useful to record
what is being carried where.

Each person uses 1 CU of space, and each utility suit also uses 1 CU. A Person
may carry (or drag) 2 CUs, not counting the utility suit he or she wears —
this allows a person to take a disabled individual to safety when wearing
suits.

### <a name="R211">Repair Units (R211B)</a>
When repairs are made (<a href="#R219">R219</a>) after damage (<a href="#R217">R217</a>) or breakdown (<a href="#R218">R218</a>), you must
expend Repair Units (RUs). One Repair Unit occupies one CU of space, and is
sufficient for one day of repair on one item of equipment (see RRR activity,
<a href="#R203">R203</a>C). Repair units are purchased in various areas (<a href="#R205">R205</a>), and are sometimes
acquired by events.

### <a name="R211">Fuel Units (R211C)</a>
A ship’s boat (<a href="#R214">R214</a>) and skimmer (<a href="#R215">R215</a>C) require Fuel Units (FUs) to operate.
One FU occupies one CU of space. A ship’s boat cannot carry over 15 FU, and a
skimmer cannot carry over 5 FU.

Star ships do not need fuel units (see <a href="#R212">R212</a>), and when hiring the use of
orbital shuttles or commercial land vehicles you can ignore FU needs —
appropriate fuel is part of the hiring cost. FUs are purchased in various
areas (<a href="#R205">R205</a>), and are sometimes acquired by events.

## <a name="R212">R212 Antelope Class Starship</a>
Duke Springer operates a small merchant starship of the Antelope class. It has
a hyper drive to allow “jumps” from one star system to another, as well as a
sub light propulsion system for travel within a star system. It is
streamlined, and can land on or take off from planets, even those with an
atmosphere. It can carry a ship’s boat, and mounts one weapons turret. The
ship can be controlled by a single individual (pilot/navigator), but there are
advantages to having a larger crew (<a href="#R221">R221</a>). Below is a reference diagram of the
starship, which can be photocopied and used for notes, etc. The diagram shows
the CUs (<a href="#R211">R211</a>A) in each compartment or area of the ship, including:

* Pilot’s Compartment: 2 CU
* Crew Quarters: 16 CU
* Gunnery Turret: 2 CU if starship guns installed, add 6 CU if starship guns removed
* Boat Hold: 40 CU if no ship’s boat present; if boat is present, it takes up all 40 CU, but there may be room within the boat (see <a href="#R214">R214</a>)
* Main Cargo Hold: 60 CU
* Engineering Compartment: 4 CU
* There are also six concealed areas numbered 1 to 6, each being 1 CU. These are in cable runs, behind access panels, in ventilation ducts, etc See <a href="#R229">R229</a>B for hiding items.

### <a name="R212">Starship Hyper drive (R212A)</a>
Star ships use hyper drive to move from one star system to another. This means
transportation is literally instantaneous, but not without risk. There is a
chance a ship using hyper drive will “dissipate” on return to normal space,
with its atoms scattered through space. This risk is greater if the ship uses
hyper drive close to a high gravity source (such as near a planet), or when
the ship is damaged. When a starship jumps, pursuit is impossible, since there
is no way to tell which way the ship went, or how far it is going. Therefore,
once you make a hyper jump, you are safe from all pursuits (assuming you
survive the jump). Of course, if you return to the star system, you may now be
“wanted” there!

### <a name="R212">Hyper charges (R212B)</a>
A starship uses hyper charges as “fuel” for jumps. The Antelope class can hold
up to six (6) hyper charges in special spaces, which cannot be used to carry
anything else (no CUs of storage here), nor can regular CU be used for
additional hyper charges

A starship makes hyper drive jumps along standard routes, as illustrated by the
connections in <a href="#R234">R234</a>. Each link between systems is a single jump. A starship
can make a “double jump” and pass directly over a system for the next one
along the route (it doesn’t stop or appear at the middle system). It is
possible to make a triple jump by passing over two systems and arriving at the
third. Hyper charge expenditure varies with the type of jump:

1. single jump: uses one (1) hyper charge
1. double jump: uses three (3) hyper charges
1. triple jump: uses five (5) hyper charges

For example, using the standard star system connection pattern (<a href="#R234">R234</a>, pattern
one), a jump from Regari to Palatek is a single jump; from Regari to Byzantium
or Imperia is a double jump, while from Regari to Talitar is a triple jump.
Nothing bigger than a triple jump is possible, so the other systems cannot be
reached from Regari in a hyper jump.

### <a name="R212">Risk Factor in Hyper drive Jumps (R212C)</a>
The Risk Factor is determined before each jump (<a href="#R212">R212</a>B), and a 1d6 roll made. If
the roll is less than or equal to the Risk Factor, the jump was a failure, see
<a href="#R212">R212</a>D for effects. If the die roll is greater than the risk factor, the jump
was successful (see <a href="#R212">R212</a>D). To determine the Risk Factor, add together all the
situations below. If no situations apply, the factor is automatically zero and
the jump cannot fail (will always be successful):

| RF | Result                                                   |
|----|----------------------------------------------------------|
| +5 | jump from surface of a planet                            |
| +4 | jump from orbit, at an asteroid, or on a space station   |
| +3 | jump from one sublight move “out” from above (see <a href="#R212">R212</a>G) |
| +2 | jump from two sublight moves “out”                       |
| +1 | jump from three sublight moves “out”                     |
| +1 | for each point of damage (hit) on the starship           |

### <a name="R212">Results of Hyperdrive Jump (R212D)</a>
See <a href="#R212">R212</a>C to compute results.

*Success:* the starship arrives at its destination intact, entering the system
four sublight moves (hours) “out” from any planet or asteroid belt. The ship
must immediately consult the System Entry procedure (<a href="#R226">R226</a>) and check for a
system entry event; even if planning to immediately make another jump. It is
impossible to arrive closer than four light-hours “out.”

*Failure:* the starship undergoes hyperspace dissipation in jump. Debris
appears four sublight moves “out” in the destination system (instead of the
starship!). Everything and everyone on board is totally destroyed. The only
exception is items and people within stasis units (<a href="#R212">R212</a>E). Stasis units appear
intact in the “out” space along with the debris. Unless you were in a stasis
unit, dissipation means instant death — the game is over.

### <a name="R212">Stasis Units (R212E)</a>
A serendipitous offshoot of hyperdrive development was the stasis phenomenon.
Stasis appears to stop time within a very restricted volume. The stasis unit
is a device turned out manually, or by an automatic trigger (activated when
hyperspace dissipation occurs, for example).

When a stasis unit is turned on, it stops time inside the unit. As a result, it
cannot be turned off from within! To turn if off, one must put the unit inside
another stasis unit, and reverse the field. Both stasis units are consumed,
and whatever was inside the smaller now returns to normal time.

A person inside a stasis and then freed will complete the breath he or she was
drawing when stasis began, a cup of coffee that was being spilled will
continue its motion, the coffee still hot, etc.

Due to the cost of stasis units and the ability to determine what is inside an
active unit, few people can meet the cost of deactivating a unit by using up a
larger one — unless they expect large rewards. Accordingly, an insurance
network has been formed to guarantee deactivation after the destruction of an
insured ship. Of course, anyone who gets to the stasis unit first can risk
opening it without insurance, if they believe it contains valuable items, or a
person who brings a good ransom.

Crewmen hire on at lower rates if they can work in stasis units with insurance,
since their life has an effective protection.

If you (Duke Springer) are in an activated stasis unit, unless the event
indicates otherwise consult <a href="#R240">R240</a> for the result. If you find an activated
stasis unit, you may open it by purchasing or having a unit 1 CU larger, and
when the larger is activated around the smaller both are lost to recover the
contents within the smaller. Stasis units cannot be used to surround and
protect a starship: use of hyperdrive jump inside one causes a massive
explosion - so much for the Navy’s attempt to use stasis protection for their
warships!

### <a name="R212">Sublight Drives (R212F)</a>
Starships use sublight drive to move within a star system. Sublight drive can
be used without limit provided the starship has at least one hypercharge on
board. Using the drive does not consume the hypercharge. Sublight drives
accelerate a ship rapidly to nearly light speed, meaning that combat between
ships using sublight drive is long and difficult, unless both wish to meet and
engage. See <a href="#R216">R216</a>A for starship guns, and <a href="#R230">R230</a>L for combat procedures.

### <a name="R212">Starship Movement within a System (R212G)</a>
A starship uses its sublight drive to move around within a star system. Each
“move” takes one hour. The various movement options available include:

*Move Out:* move one hour further “out” to leave the system, this can be from
any planet or asteroid; hyperdrive can be safely used by undamaged ships from
four (4) moves “out,” see <a href="#R212">R212</a>C.

*Move In:* move one hour further “in” toward the system. This can be toward any
planet or asteroid. If one move (hour) “out” and moving “in,” the starship
arrives in orbit after the hour.

*Move Orbit to Orbit:* move from orbit around one planet to orbit around
another. Orbit in the asteroids is like an orbit around another planet.

*Move Orbit/Docking:* move from orbit to docking at a space station at that
planet (or in the asteroids), or vice versa.

Note that from docking, a ship must first move to orbit, and then begin moving
“out” in later hours.

Climb/Descend: move down to surface of planet (or asteroid) from orbit or space
station, or climb from surface to orbit or space station.

Note that a direct move to or from surface to either a space station or orbit
is possible in one hour.

Area to Area on Surface: move through atmosphere from one area on the planet to
another. This is possible provided entry restrictions permit a Spaceship to
move into such an area (see <a href="#R205">R205</a>).

Entry Encounters (<a href="#R225">R225</a>) occur when moving to a space station dock, or to any
area on the surface (either descending to it, or moving through the atmosphere
to it). There are no entry encounters for moves in space or orbit.

### <a name="R212">Starship Communications (R212H)</a>
A starship may use its communications equipment provided the ship is not
destroyed. Communications equipment is foolproof, and will never break-down.
There is no fuel used, and no Hypercharges are needed. Any qualified starship
crewman may operate communications gear.

Communications travels at the speed of light. A ship using sublight drive in a
star system moves at about the speed of communication, making interception up
ahead very difficult. Communication at a planet, including to orbit or space
station, is virtually instantaneous, as is communication between starships. No
communication is possible into or out of an activated stasis unit. There is no
normal communication from one star system to another.

## <a name="R213">R213 Life Support</a>
Life support is automatically present inside a starship, on a planet with
“good” air, on orbital shuttles, and in certain areas on any planet regardless
of air (those with the title of the area in white-colored type, see <a href="#R204">R204</a>G). In
any other situation, including situations with bad or no air, or in space life
support is required.

A utility suit provides life support for one day to the wearer. If the wearer
is accompanied by a PS robot (<a href="#R222">R222</a>C), life support last indefinitely — for as
many days as the robot accompanies the wearer. After the robot leaves the suit
can still provide life support for one more day alone.

A life support unit (LSU) carried on a ship’s boat will provide life support to
everyone within the boat for one day. LSUs will not function in a skimmer,
because a skimmer is not air-tight (the LSU effect will therefore leak away
instantly).

In an emergency, a PS robot (<a href="#R222">R222</a>C) can provide life support for any character
for one hour, even if without a utility suit.

A character without life support for five minutes will die. Five minutes is
enough time to put on a utility suit, get to a PS robot, or get into a
starship or ship’s boat (with LSU). If none of these are immediately
available, death will result unless the character is carrying a stasis unit
and turns it on.

### <a name="R213">Starship Life Support (R213A)</a>
Continues to function until the ship itself is destroyed, or an event causes a
compartment of the ship to depressurize, be opened to space, etc. No fuel or
hypercharges are used or required for the life support function, and it will
never break down.

### <a name="R213">Utility Suit Sealing (R213B)</a>
A character in a utility suit who suffers just one hit from a nonexplosive
weapon (<a href="#R230">R230</a> for combat, <a href="#R231">R231</a> for wound effects) will automatically self-seal
and continue life support. If multiple wounds result, or the weapon has
explosive rounds, the suit cannot seal and its life-support function fails
instantly. Hand-to-hand combat will never damage a utility suit. Utility suits
may break down (<a href="#R218">R218</a>), check at the end of each day, like other equipment.

## <a name="R214">R214 Hopper Class Ship’s Boat</a>
The standard ship’s boat for merchant ships, including the Antelope class, is
the Hopper class. The boat is sealed for operation in space or any atmosphere,
but requires life support units if the crew or passengers are without their
own. The boat consumes fuel units at a relatively high rate, and this is
mainly used for short excursions. It has folding wings, and may be
glide-landed without power (and thus without fuel use) on a planet with
atmosphere.

The Hopper class requires one person to operate, who must be a qualified pilot
(including starship pilots).

### <a name="R214">Storage (R214A)</a>
The Hopper class overall is 40 CU in size, and thus requires that space inside
a starship when being transported by a starship.

The internal capacity of the Hopper boat is 25 CU: 5 CU control & passenger
compartment, and four other 5 CU compartments. The passenger and control area
will contain the pilot, any other passengers, items they can carry including
PS robots, and/or LSUs. The other compartments may contain fuel, passengers,
or other items including boat guns (5 CU), LSUs, etc. One LSU per day will
provide life support for everyone and everything inside a Hopper class boat.

No more than 15 CUs of fuel (15 FU) may be on the boat at any one time, since
only three of the other compartments have fuel fittings.

### <a name="R214">Speed & Engine Operation (R214B)</a>
A Hopper boat consumes one FU (fuel Unit) per hour for normal travel. This
includes moving about from area to area on a planet, dropping from orbit
(unless an unpowered glide is used), or moving about in orbit (to or from a
space station and/or asteroid). On the planet, the boat can travel up to 10
land steps per hour.

Climbing from the surface of a planet to orbit consumes fuel units equal to the
gravity of the planet. For example, climbing to orbit on a gravity 5 planet
takes 5 FUs — all expended in that hour. The engines of the Hopper boat are
limited to a power of 9 — they cannot use more than 9 FU at a time, and thus
the boat is unable to climb from planets of 10 or higher gravity.

The only way to get a boat off such a planet is to carry it within a starship,
or use an orbital shuttle.

A Hopper boat can travel from one planet to another (or from planet to asteroid
area, or vice versa). However, it is not as fast as a starship. The type of
travel takes an entire day, and consumes 10 F U.

Loading and unloading a boat from a starship is very easy, and takes no extra
time.

## <a name="R215">R215 Planetary Vehicles</a>
There are three main types of planetary vehicle: orbital shuttle,
various commercial land vehicles, and the skimmer.

### <a name="R215">Orbital Shuttle (R215A)</a>
You may “book passage” for persons and/or cargo on the orbital shuttle at
either a spaceport or space station. It will travel to either spaceport, space
station, or orbit, as desired. Booking passage is represented by a contact try
(<a href="#R227">R227</a>) at the spaceport or space station that results in a “commercial
vehicle” (<a href="#E074">E074</a>) event.

The planet has no spaceport on the ground, commercial vehicle contact at a
colony allows one to book passage on a shuttle.

The shuttle can carry up to 50 CU, but may not carry items prohibited from
transport on that planet (if event paragraphs have mentioned such). The
shuttle automatically provides its own fuel and life support for all inside at
no extra cost. Every 3 CU of space on the shuttle costs 1 Sec.

The shuttle takes one hour to reach its destination, including loading and
unloading times.

### <a name="R215">Commercial Land Vehicles (R215B)</a>
These include trains, buses, planes, helicopters, ground effect vehicles,
subways, monorails, and innumerable other methods for local transportation.
They are only hired by the hour, at 3 CU space per 1 Sec of cost when event
(<a href="#E074">E074</a>) occurs (often through a contact try, <a href="#R227">R227</a>, in specific planetary areas).

A commercial vehicle moves one land step per hour, or one hour to move from one
area to an adjacent one. Additional hours
increase the cost.

A commercial vehicle holds 9 CU; you can hire more than one vehicle for larger
loads, but no one item can be larger than 9 CU as a result. You may hire the
vehicle for a one-way trip.

A commercial vehicle must be paid in advance, and remains available (once
hired) only for the paid-in-advance period. During the period, you can
increase the time available by paying more, but as soon as money runs out the
vehicle instantly departs and cannot be recalled without a new contact try,
etc. Commercial vehicles can travel to areas of bad or no air. Skimmers (<a href="#R215">R215</a>C)

These are small private vehicles typical to inhabited planets of the sector.
They use air-breathing engines, and thus are limited to areas of good or bad
air. A skimmer purchased on a planet with bad air (<a href="#R204">R204</a>F) can only function on
that planet, while skimmers from all other planets won’t work. A skimmer
travels one land step per hour, and requires a qualified driver to operate.

Skimmers are 10 CU in size, and can hold up to 6 CUs of passengers, fuel,
cargo, etc. A skimmer moves one land step per hour, and uses one FU per day.
It has no life support, and is not sealed.

Skimmers cannot be hired, instead the 3 CU or 6 CU commercial vehicle is the
“hired” equivalent (see <a href="#R215">R215</a>B above).

## <a name="R216">R216 Weaponry</a>
Weapons, like all other equipment, have a tech level ranging from 1 to 6, with
the higher numbers more advanced. Higher tech “ranged weapons” fire before
lower level weapons in combat (<a href="#<a href="#R230">R230</a>">R230</a>F), and are more likely to hit (R230D).
Advanced weapons often do more damage, especially explosive weapons (<a href="#R230">R230</a>E).
Weapons may be purchased through contacts (<a href="#R227">R227</a>), acquired in events, or taken
from an opponent defeat in combat.

A character needs a marksmanship rating of one (1) or higher (<a href="#R201">R201</a>A) to fire a
weapon. Characters with marksmanship of zero cannot fire weapons. Robots are
unable to fire weapons, their programming prohibits it. Certain weapons can
only be used by certain types of characters, as described below.

### <a name="R216">Starship Guns (R216A)</a>
These powerful energy beam weapons must be mounted in starships, the Antelope
class can fit one set of guns in its turret. They can only be fired by a
qualified starship gunner in the turret. If starship guns are purchased, they
are installed at that time if the starship is present; otherwise a starship
engineer (<a href="#R221">R221</a>B) can install them in one day of RRR (<a href="#R203">R203</a>C) devoted to the
task.

A hit from starship guns reduces an individual’s Endurance (<a href="#R231">R231</a>) by ten
points, or inflicts one hit on a vehicle (may be a critical hit, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>L).

### <a name="R216">Boat Guns (R216B)</a>
These large weapons require 5 CU of space and are installed only in a ship’s
boat. A qualified starship gunner is needed to fire them, and a boat pilot
cannot also fire the guns. When purchased, boat guns are installed at that
time if the boat is present; otherwise a starship engineer can install them
(<a href="#R22">R22</a>lb) in one day of RRR (<a href="#R203">R203</a>C) devoted to the task.

A hit from boat guns may reduce an individual’s Endurance or disable
him (<a href="#R231">R231</a>), or inflict one hit on a vehicle (may be a critical hit, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>K).

### <a name="R216">Skimmer Guns (R216C)</a>
These medium weapons require 2 CU of space and are installed on a skimmer.
Starship gunners and bodyguards with marksmanship of one (1) or higher, or
Duke Springer, can fire them, except the driver of the skimmer. When
purchased, skimmer guns are installed at that time if the skimmer is present;
otherwise a starship engineer or repairman can install them in one day of RRR
(<a href="#R203">R203</a>C) devoted to the task.

A hit from skimmer guns may reduce an individual’s Endurance or disable
him (<a href="#R231">R231</a>), or may inflict one hit on a vehicle (may be a critical hit,
see <a href="#R230">R230</a>K).

### <a name="R216">Personal Weapons (R216D)</a>
These light weapons are carried by individuals. Heavy hand weapons are 1 CU in
size and can only be used by starship gunners, bodyguards, or Duke Springer,
Sidearms take up no space, and can be used by anyone. A crate of 10 sidearms,
in cargo, takes up 2 CU.

Marksmanship of 1 or better is required to fire any type of personal weapon.
Personal weapons cannot be fired while driving a skimmer, piloting a boat, or
fired out of a boat or starship (but may be fired within the vehicle). A hit
from personal weapons may reduce an individual’s Endurance or disable him
(<a href="#R231">R231</a>), or may inflict a hit on certain types of vehicles only (see <a href="#R230">R230</a>K).

## <a name="R217">R217 Damage</a>
If a shot hits a vehicle (<a href="#R230">R230</a>), the result is given as a “hit” or a “critical
hit.” Each vehicle can absorb a certain number of hits before it is destroyed.
The effects of weapons and injury on individuals are described in <a href="#R231">R231</a>. When a
vehicle is destroyed by hits, it cannot function for any purpose, and repair
is no longer possible.

### <a name="R217">Starship Damage (R217A)</a>
Starships (Antelope class) take 10 hits to destroy. Sidearms and heavy hand
weapons have no effect on starships unless an event paragraph indicates
otherwise. Individual points of damage simply increase the risk factor when
hyperjumping.

### <a name="R217">Ship’s Boat Damage (R217B)</a>
Ship’s boat (Hopper class) takes 5 hits to destroy. Sidearms have no effect on
ship’s boat unless an event paragraph indicates otherwise. Individual points
of damage have no special effect unless critical hits (see <a href="#R237">R237</a> for effects).
Shuttles are similar to ship’s boat.

### <a name="R217">Skimmer Damage (R217C)</a>
Skimmers (and commercial vehicles) take only 2 hits to destroy. One hit will
immobilize the vehicle until repaired. Sidearm hits do not damage unless a
critical hit results, in which case normal damage and the critical hit effect
(<a href="#R237">R237</a>) both apply, meaning at least the immobilization of the vehicle.

## <a name="R218">R218 Break-down</a>
As you use vehicles and other equipment, break-down may occur. If an items
breaks down, it cannot be used until it is repaired (<a href="#R219">R219</a>). Break-down does
not add any damage points, and never causes destruction.

Normally, you must check for break-down after each day for each item, vehicle,
etc. that was used that day. You do not need to check vehicles that did not
move, items not used (including those simply carried, but not used), nor
starships or ship’s boats in orbit, at a space station, or at an asteroid.
Break-down for vehicles and weapons are determined separately. Communications
and life support equipment on starships or ship’s boat will never break down.

### <a name="R218">Break-down Check (R218A)</a>
When break-down is checked, roll 2d6 and compare the result to the item’s tech
level. If the dice roll is less than or equal to the tech level, the item
breaks down. Note that a roll of “1” is not possible with two dice, and thus
tech level 1 items never break down.

### <a name="R218">Preventive Maintenance (R218B)</a>
This is performed to reduce the chance of break-down. GM robots (<a href="#R222">R222</a>A) can
perform it on starships and ship’s boat. Starship engineers can do preventive
maintenance on any equipment or vehicle.

Preventive maintenance takes an entire day of work for the man or robot, who
cannot do anything else, and will be prevented from doing it by combat or some
other interruption. All items and vehicles at that location get the benefit of
the maintenance. More than one engineer and/or robot at the location does not
increase the benefits in any way.

If an engineer performed maintenance, all items add two (+2) to breakdown rolls
that day, and add one (+1) to break-down rolls for the next two days afterward.

If a GM robot performed maintenance, all items add one (+1) to breakdown rolls
that day and the following day.

## <a name="R219">R219 Repair of Vehicles & Equipment</a>
When vehicles or equipment break-down, or are damaged, they must be repaired
to be fully functional again. Note, however, that some damage has no material
effect, and can be ignored (although the vehicle is closer to destruction until
the damage is repaired). Repair is done during a day of RRR (<a href="#R203">R203</a>C) by a
qualified person.

A starship engineer may repair any part of a starship, including the ship
itself, a ship’s boat or any part thereof, or a skimmer. This includes repair
of starship guns, boat guns, and/or skimmer guns.

A repairman or mobile repairman can repair anything except a starship or ship’s
boat equipment (or the vehicle itself).

A skimmer driver can only repair a skimmer.

Repairs require the item or vehicle to be at the same location as the person
repairing it. Normally, equipment must be brought to hired repairmen. Mobile
repairmen can travel to the equipment’s location.

### <a name="R219">Repair Units (R219A)</a>
In any repair, one Repair Unit (<a href="#R211">R211</a>) is consumed per day of repair on a single
item of equipment. Repair Units (RUs) may be purchased in any area where
vehicle repair may be obtained. RUs are not needed for preventive maintenance.

### <a name="R219">Speed of Repair (R219B)</a>
A starship engineer repairs 1d6 hits on a starship per day, and one hit per day
for other items. A repairman, or mobile repairman in his home area, repairs
1d6 hits per day. A mobile repairman who traveled to another area only fixes
one hit per day. A skimmer driver can only repair one hit per day.

If an item has broken down (<a href="#R218">R218</a>) any repair with one RU will fix it, in
addition to repair hits of damage as noted above. However, even with no hits,
a broken-down item still requires repair work and one RU.

## <a name="R220">#R220 Retinue</a>
As the adventure progresses, you may hire or otherwise gain crew-members and
followers. When a character joins your “party,” note his or her basic
statistics (<a href="#R201">R201</a>A) and skills. You can voluntarily dismiss or abandon members
of your party, although this can cause problems (see below).

### <a name="R220">Hirelings (R220A)</a>
A person hired as a starship crewman must be paid “sign-on” money sometimes, at
the time of hiring. The daily or weekly salary must be paid at the start of
each day or week, and may be modified if the crewman is working in a stasis
unit with insurance coverage. All costs are noted in event paragraphs, and are
normally modified by the wealth code of. the system. See (<a href="#R223">R223</a>A) for equipment
used by hirelings.

If a salary is not paid in advance, at the start of each day you can attempt to
convince them to keep working anyway with a successful cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>). If
this fails, the character will leave you as soon as he or she arrives in an
area with good air. Until that time, the person does not work, and will
automatically side against you in any encounter (join opposition in combat
against you, inform customs searches of contraband, etc.).

### <a name="R220">Abandonment, Insurance & Death Payments (R220B)</a>
A member of your party could leave due to an event, normal end of employment,
or Is simply left behind with life support or in an area with good air —
outside of a combat situation. Here you have no further obligation to the
person. If the person is killed, abandoned in combat, or left without life
support where it is needed, you must make a death payment on that day or the
following day to a bank. If you don’t make the payment on time, you can never
again hire anyone from the star system where the person was hired, except
those who don’t require any death payment.

Death payments can be deposited in advance at any bank in the person’s home
system for an extra 10% fee. If the person leaves your party and no death
payment is needed, you can recover the money the next time you are in an area
with banking facilities in that system.

Stasis insurance is obtained by installing a stasis unit in the work space of
the crewman (1 CU for a man alone, 2 CU for a man with suit), and by
depositing money sufficient for the next largest size stasis unit plus 10% at
any bank. Insurance money is never refunded, regardless of circumstances when
the person leaves your employ. See <a href="#R212">R212</a>E for stasis unit details.

### <a name="R220">Isolated Persons (R220C)</a>
Persons of your party may be left somewhere while you go elsewhere. While
isolated from you, the others cannot travel, engage in work, combat, try for
contact or other activities. The only exception is that they may perform RRR
activities (<a href="#R203">R203</a>C), such as repair, preventive maintenance, or healing wounds.
The normal RRR encounter may occur (see <a href="#R227">R227</a>A), and if it does, they make no
resistance to the event, and will be automatically defeated in any combat.

Isolated individuals will consume life support and/or repair units as necessary
for their existence and tasks. Bodyguards (<a href="#R221">R221</a>D) may not be voluntarily left
in isolation from you, but events may force them to become isolated.

## <a name="R221">R221 Roles of Hirelings</a>

### <a name="R221">Pilot/Navigator (R221A)</a>
A crewman who can operate a starship, using its hyperdrive, sublight drive,
and/or make an unpowered landing on a planet with atmosphere. In addition, he
can control and pilot a ship’s boat and/or drive a skimmer. He cannot perform
operate, perform repairs, or conduct preventive maintenance on any other
items, except for an ability to operate sidearms (if he has a marksmanship of
1 or higher). He will defend himself if attacked in hand-to-hand combat, but
will not attack. As a starship crewman, the pilot is able to operate starship
communications equipment.

### <a name="R221">Starship Engineer (R221B)</a>
A crewman who can perform preventive maintenance or make repairs on any
starship or ship’s boat equipment, or on a skimmer. He can drive a skimmer,
but cannot pilot a starship or ship’s boat. He cannot use any weapons except
sidearms (and then only if he has marksmanship of 1 or more), and only defends
himself if attacked in hand-to-hand combat. As a starship crewman he can
operate communications equipment.

### <a name="R221">Starship Gunner (R221C)</a>
A crewman who operates the starship’s gun turret. He can also operate boat guns
or skimmer guns, and can use personal weapons (heavy hand weapons or
sidearms). He can drive a skimmer, but not a starship or ship’s boat. He
cannot perform repairs, nor preventive maintenance. He can attack as well as
defend in hand-to-hand combat, and as a starship crewman can operate starship
communications equipment.

### <a name="R221">Bodyguard (R221D)</a>
A hireling who can use skimmer guns, heavy hand weapons, and/or sidearms, but
is unable to fire starship guns or boat guns. He can attack or defend or
hand-to-hand combat. A bodyguard only fights if with Duke Springer, he will
not fight if isolated. He cannot perform any repair or preventive maintenance,
and cannot operate starship communications equipment.

### <a name="R221">Skimmer Driver (R221E)</a>
A hireling who can drive a skimmer or repair it. Skimmer drivers cannot do
preventive maintenance, will not use any weapons, nor attack in hand-to-hand
combat. Skimmer drivers will never voluntarily leave their system of origin,
and will not work for you if “kidnapped” from their home star system.

### <a name="R221">Medic (R221F)</a>
A hireling qualified to perform emergency first aid (<a href="#R231">R231</a>B), and useful in
certain special events. A medic cannot use weapons, will attempt to avoid any
hand-to-hand combat, and cannot operate any other equipment, do preventive
maintenance, or perform repairs.

## <a name="R222">R222 Robots</a>
There are three principal types of robots. All robots have fail-safe
programming features that prevent them from being used in any type of combat.
Each robot has an endurance of 2, takes 1 CU space, and is self-powered with a
small battery. There is a small operating cost every 10-day week, representing
new batteries and other consumables needed to keep a robot running. If this is
not paid, the robot automatically breaks down.

### <a name="R222">GM (General Maintenance) Robot (R222A)</a>

Can perform preventive maintenance duties on all items within a starship and/or
ship’s boat (see <a href="#R218">R218</a>B) but cannot perform repairs. A GM Robot cannot function
on equipment whose tech level is higher than the tech level of the robot. A GM
robot can maintain other GM robots, but cannot maintain itself nor other
robots. Operating cost is 2 S per 10-day week.

### <a name="R222">U (Utility) Robot (R222B)</a>
used to carry loads up to 3 CU (in addition to the 1 CU the robot itself
occupies). It has no other function. Operating cost is 1 S per 10-day week.

### <a name="R222">PS (Personal Support) Robot (R222C)</a>
Programmed to support a single, specific individual only. When a PS Robot is
connected to a person in a utility suit, the result is indefinite life support
(<a href="#R213">R213</a>). If the PS robot is connected to a person without a suit, the person
can be kept alive for one hour.

A PS Robot can perform emergency first aid (<a href="#R213">R213</a>B) and can call for medical
assistance (<a href="#R231">R231</a>C). It cannot provide healing (unlike a medic). The robot can
be used for any ordinary radio-communicator calls on that planet, including to
orbit or a space station, but not to another planet or star system. Operating
cost is 2 S per 10-day week.

### <a name="R222">Robot Use & Break-down (R222D)</a>
Robots may be used in any environment, including bad air or vacuum, and do not
require life support. As with any equipment, you must check for break-down for
each day you use each robot (<a href="#R218">R218</a>).

## <a name="R223">R223 Hirelings’ Equipment & Goods</a>

### <a name="R223">Hirelings’ Equipment (R223A)</a>
Any equipment used by a hireling, which he personally carries, becomes the
personal equipment and property of that person. This includes sidearms, heavy
hand weapons, PS robots, etc. Exceptions are U or GM robots, vehicles,
equipment mounted in vehicles, etc.

As a result, you may need to give equipment to a hireling from time to time.
You can take back the “given” equipment later, but must succeed with a Cunning
roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>) to prevent the hireling from quitting. If a hireling is not paid
and leaves, he automatically takes personal equipment with him, you are unable
to take it back regardless of cunning (although you can try to use your
cunning to have him continue working for you without pay for that day, see
<a href="#R220">R220</a>A).

### <a name="R223">Acquiring Equipment without Purchase (R223B)</a>
Certain events may allow you to find intact or damaged equipment without
spending money. In addition, if you defeat others in combat, you may take any
equipment or valuables they have (indicated in the event), assuming it wasn’t
damaged or destroyed in battle. Damaged equipment that you can move can also
be taken.

You take prisoners after combat only if so indicated in the event paragraph.
Otherwise, those who are not killed are assumed to escape.

Each person you encounter will have “pocket change” in Secs equal to a 1d6
cross-indexed with the system’s wealth code on table <a href="#R241">R241</a>. Ignore any
fractional Secs of pocket change. In other words, pocket change is base price
of 1 S times multiplier given on that table.

## <a name="R224">R224 Encounters</a>
There are two main types of encounters: Entry Encounters and Contact Try
Encounters. Each type is described in detail below (<a href="#R225">R225</a>-226-227). All
encounters use the same standard resolution procedure:

If you encounter any people, note the characteristics of each (<a href="#R201">R201</a>A).
Sometimes a characteristic is determined by a die roll, at times with a
certain amount added or subtracted. For example, “1d6+1” means one die roll
with one added. Minimum characteristic possible is 0, unless other minimums or
maximums are given.

If persons encountered have skills, note this. Generally, any characters
encountered with heavy hand weapons automatically have bodyguard skill. If
persons have vehicles, assume all of them have sufficient skill to operate it
(skimmer driver if in skimmers, pilot/navigators if in ship’s boat or
starship). Pocket change is determined after the encounter, if needed.

If the person have any equipment, such as weapons, robots, etc., refer to the
Tech Level table (<a href="#R235">R235</a>) to determine the level of their equipment. Roll just
once — they all have equipment of the same tech level.

## <a name="R225">R225 Entry Detection & Entry Encounters</a>
Whenever you enter a new area within a star system, there may be an Entry
Encounter. When moving to a new star system, see <a href="#R226">R226</a> for details.

### <a name="R225">Detection (R225A)</a>
First, determine if you are detected. Refer to the Entry Detection Table (<a href="#R238">R238</a>)
and cross-reference the mode of entry and the tech code of the system and add
or subtract a certain amount when entering certain types of areas (see table)
to give your detection factor. Then roll one die (1d6). If the result is less
than or equal to the detection factor you are detected. If the result is
greater than your detection factor, you enter undetected and no entry
encounter occurs. Entering undetected often means that nobody paid any
attention to you, rather than you sneaking in totally unseen.

You can enter asteroid and orbit areas undetected at any time — no detection
check is necessary, and no encounters occur.

### <a name="R225">Entry Encounters (R225B)</a>
If you are detected (see <a href="#R225">R225</a>A), you must now roll one die (1d6), subtract one
(-1), and cross-reference the result with the type of area entered or the
Entry & Contact Table (<a href="#R233">R233</a>). Most results refer to a specific events
paragraph (EOOO). A few refer to a specific rules paragraph with a special
listing, and some refer to the “SYST” chart on the Encounter Table, where
another 1d6 roll is cross-referenced with the star system you are in now.

### <a name="R225">Entry in Stasis (R225C)</a>
If you arrive anywhere in a stasis unit because of voluntary or automatic
activation (<a href="#R212">R212</a>E), refer to recovery from stasis table (<a href="#R240">R240</a>) and roll 1d6
for the result before you continue play.

## <a name="R226">R226 System Entry Encounters</a>
Whenever you hyperjump to a new star system you must check for a system entry
encounter immediately upon arrival. To do this, refer to the proper system in
<a href="#R207">R207</a>, and roll 1d6. After this event, you can begin moving in your starship to
any planet or the asteroids (see <a href="#R212">R212</a>G).

Once you undergo the system entry table in <a href="#R207">R207</a>, you need not check it again
until you hyperjump and arrive at a new star system. System entry results are
not required if you move from one planet to another (or to/from asteroids)
within a star system.

## <a name="R227">R227 Contact Try Encounters</a>
Like most enterprising merchants, much of your time will be spent buying and
selling items, trying to gain information about the market and general
situation, etc. This activity is represented by “contact tries” during a day.
The result will be encounters, some of them unpleasant, of course.

Contact tries are not possible in orbit, or at an asteroid.

Contact tries during a normal day are entirely voluntary (except in RRR, see
<a href="#R227">R227</a>A below). A contact try is only possible if at least one hour remains in
the day. You must leave your vehicle (if any) to make a contact try, but if
the resulting event occurs at “dispersed” (long) range, you can return to your
vehicle for the start of the event, if desired.

To make a contact try, cross-reference the area you currently occupy with a 1d6
roll on the Entry & Contact Table <a href="#R233">R233</a>. The result is either an events
paragraph, a reference to a special rules paragraph, or a “SYST” result that
refers you to the SYST sector of that same table (<a href="#R233">R233</a>) where you
cross-reference a second 1d6 roll with the star system you are in. If you have
spent more than one consecutive day in this area, for each consecutive day
after the first you add one (+1) to the contact try die roll. Only days in
which at least one contact try is attempted may be counted. Should you leave
the area, you lose benefit of all days spent there.

### <a name="R227">Contact During RRR (R227A)</a>
If you spend a day in RRR, or isolated characters spend a day in RRR (<a href="#R203">R203</a>C),
there is a possibly of an encounter roll 1d6: if a “6” results, an encounter
occurs. Roll 1d6 again and consult <a href="#R233">R233</a>. In any contact try encounters, the
1d6 rolls are not modified, regardless of how many days are spent in the area.
If the contact results in an event that means combat, or causes the persons to
go someplace else (even within the same area), all RRR activities for that day
are prevented.

## <a name="R228">R228 Ship’s Papers, Personal ID, and the Wanted List</a>
You begin the game with a set of official papers identifying yourself and your
starship. Any hirelings who join you also have official and valid
identification unless otherwise indicated. You start the game “not wanted” in
any of the ten star systems, and your papers are valid in all systems.

Some events or rules indicate that you become “wanted” in that star system.
When this occurs, record the fact. Once your are “wanted” in the system, you
will remain that way (the police have long memories).

Some events paragraph may permit you to obtain new (forged) papers for
yourself, your starship, and/or hirelings. When traveling under a new name,
you will become “unwanted” again, until you do something in that name that
causes you to become “wanted.” Of course, while traveling under forged papers
you may be discovered, and that alone will be enough to make you “wanted”
again, if not arrested outright!

The use of forged papers means you must keep track of each set of papers, and
whether that identity is “wanted” anywhere.

## <a name="R229">R229 Cargo, Goods, and Services</a>
Buying and selling items is an important part of being a Star Smuggler, since
it’s the main way to become rich. Normally money (Secs, <a href="#R232">R232</a>A) is used in
any-transaction, unless the event specifies some sort of trade.

### <a name="R229">Buying, Selling, and Salaries (R229A)</a>
Most events give specific costs or salaries for goods and services. This price
is normally listed as the base price in Secs (S). The base price is modified
by the wealth code of the star system, to given the actual price. Wealth codes
are listed in <a href="#R207">R207</a>.

To determine actual price, roll 1d6 and compare it with the system’s wealth
code on the Base Price Multiplier Table (<a href="#R241">R241</a>). Multiply the result on this
table by the base price to get the actual price. For example, a sidearm with a
base price of 5 S is available in the Palatek system (wealth 30). With a 1d6
roll of “1”, <a href="#R241">R241</a> indicates a multiplier of “x1”, so the price is (5x1=) 5 S.
If the 1d6 roll was “6” , the resulting multiplier is “x3”, so the actual cost
is (5x3=) 15 S.

Premium Prices mean, that when consulting <a href="#R241">R241</a>, increase the wealth code one
level (move down one row) and add one to the 1d6 roll (move to the right one
column) to get the premium price.

Devaluated Prices mean that when consulting <a href="#R241">R241</a>, decrease the wealth code one
level (move up one row), and subtract one to the 1d6 (move to the left one
column) roll to get the devaluated price.

Any premium or devalued price modifiers that move the result off the table are
ignored (i.e., stay within the limits of the table).

### <a name="R229">Carrying & Hiding Items (R229B)</a>
All persons, equipment and cargo occupy space, measured in Capacity Units (CUs,
see <a href="#R211">R211</a>). To carry an item, sufficient CU-carrying ability is required. Any
items not carried by party members, in one of your vehicles, or in a cache
(<a href="#R229">R229</a>C) are abandoned and lost. Materials in the starship must have the
storage location noted. The starship has six 1 CU hiding places that can be
used, as well as normal compartments. There are no “hiding places” in other
vehicles, in robots, or anywhere else unless indicated in the event. Of
course, an item in an activated stasis unit (<a href="#R212">R212</a>E) cannot be observed or
examined.

### <a name="R229">Caches (R229C)</a>
Some events can cost you much of your current possessions, or cost considerable
money. To avoid some of these results, you can cache money or equipment at the
end of any day. Caches can only be formed if you did not travel that day. When
you later return to the area of the cache, you can spend 1d6 hours at the
start of the day looking for it. Consult the Cache Table (<a href="#R242">R242</a>) for the
results. As a general rule, asteroids are the best places to cache items.

Items that require life support will die unless left in a place with life
support, or placed within an activated stasis unit (<a href="#R212">R212</a>E).

Items that require a continual operating cost in Secs (such as robots) will
automatically break down unless placed within an activated stasis unit (<a href="#R212">R212</a>E).

### <a name="R229">Starship Searches (R229D)</a>
Some events require a search of the starship (by customs officials, a military
patrol, quarantine officers, etc.). When this occurs, roll 2d6 and consult the
results below to see which parts of the ship are searched. Anything in those
compartments will be found. Items within activated stasis units are normally
confiscated by authorities, unless the event indicates otherwise:

## <a name="R230">R230 Combat</a>
When your character and/or party decide to “fight” opponents, or are forced to
fight, the combat rules apply.

### <a name="R230">Combat Procedure (R230A)</a>
Combat is fought in rounds. Each round represents about 5 minutes of action.
The rounds continue until one side escapes, is wiped out (or completely
disabled), or the conflict is resolved otherwise as described in the event.

Each round you decide whether you are trying to escape or not. Then you decide
which combat zone you wish to fight at (see <a href="#R230">R230</a>B), you must already be in
dispersed zone, and remain there, to attempt escape. Finally, all attacks are
resolved, with ranged weapons firing first in order of tech level (higher tech
fires first), and then hand-to-hand attacks in order of hand-to-hand combat
skill characteristics (higher characteristic attacks first).

A character may spend a round doing some special action, such as piloting a
vehicle, carrying someone to safety, carrying items in or out of a vehicle,
etc. Any such special activity prevents changing zones or making any attacks.
The character can still be attacked.

### <a name="R230">Combat Zones (Ranges) (R230B)</a>
There are two zones, or ranges, of combat: dispersed and contact. When in the
dispersed zone, only ranged weapons can be used. When in contact, only
hand-to-hand attacks are allowed.

Contact is determined person by person. Some persons may be in contact, while
others remain dispersed. A person may be contacted by someone, while
contacting another himself (or contacting no one). Contact occurs voluntarily.

#### Selecting Zones
You decide which zones your characters prefer, and against which opponents (see
selecting opponents, below). You cannot attempt contact with a hireling who
refuses to attack hand-to-hand (see <a href="#R221">R221</a>).

Opponents will attempt to make hand-to-hand contact if their hand-to-hand
ability exceeds their marksmanship. Otherwise they will try to remain
dispersed.

#### Avoiding Contact
A character may avoid contact, and force his enemy to remain at dispersed
range, if he has a higher hand-to-hand combat ability, and sacrifices any use
of ranged fire weapons that round. The enemy can attempt to get into contact
with someone else on the following round.

Note: it is often helpful to list opposing persons in combat, and use pencil
arrows to indicate when a character gets in contact (erase it when he or she
decides to leave contact).

#### Initial Zone
All combat begins at dispersed zone unless the event occurs inside a vehicle,
or indicates contact zone specifically. During the first round characters in
the dispersed zone cannot close to contact. In addition, surprise may further
limit actions (see <a href="#R230">R230</a>I).

### <a name="R230">Selecting Opponents (R230C)</a>
Normally people pair off one-against-one in combat, and engage characters in
their own zone as much as possible. That is, dispersed persons will pair off
and exchange fire, while contact persons will tend to contact each other
one-to-one. If the enemy outnumbers you, they will add a second attacker
against each target as evenly as possible, etc. If the enemy has inferior
numbers, you can decide which they attack, and which remain unattacked.

You can always order specific people in your party to engage specific targets,
including having a number of people “gang up” to attack a single target, even
if the enemy is of equal or superior strength. The only exception is that your
characters in contact with an enemy must attack that enemy.

Remember that robots cannot attack, and are simply victims of attacks.

### <a name="R230">Ranged Weapon Fire (R230D)</a>
Ranged weapons include sidearms, heavy hand weapons, skimmer guns, boat guns,
and starship guns. Starship guns use a special firing procedure, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>L.

To fire a ranged weapon, add together the weapon’s tech level, and the user’s
marksmanship characteristic (<a href="#R201">R201</a>A). Then roll 2d6, if the result is less than
or equal to the total, the weapon hits. Any higher dice roll is a miss. If you
hit, and either of the two dice read “6”, it is a critical hit.

Ranged weapons cannot be fired by a character who contacted another, or who
changed zones this round. The only exception is passengers in a vehicle may
fire weapons, while the driver controls the vehicle and does the zone-changing
for the entire group in that vehicle.

Ranged weapons fired at a character who was in contact, or contacted by the
enemy throughout this round have special problems. When firing into a
“continuous contact” situation, if the shot misses its intended target, it
will automatically hit the other person instead. As a result, you might hit
your friend by accident!

### <a name="R230">Damage from Ranged Weapon Hits (R230E)</a>
An individual who takes a normal hit from a normal weapon suffers just one hit,
and his endurance is reduced by one. When endurance reaches zero the character
is dead (see <a href="#R231">R231</a>).

An individual who receives a critical hit from a normal weapon must roll 1d6
again: “1” or “6” means he is disabled but loses no endurance (see <a href="#R231">R231</a>), any
other result (2-5) means he receives that many hits, and loses that amount
from his endurance. These multiple hits will destroy a utility suit (it will
not automatically seal).

If an individual is hit by an explosive weapon, normal and critical results are
ignored. Instead, a special 2d6 roll is made. If the result is 2-7 then that
many hits occur. If the result is 8-12, he is disabled from concussion but
suffers no endurance loss or hits.

Note that combat in areas without life support can be very dangerous, since any
multiple hit will destroy the suit (prevent it from sealing), and cause death
in five minutes. A functioning PS robot with the character will avoid this
danger, as will getting the wounded person into a new suit or into a life
supported area.

### <a name="R230">Sequence of Ranged Weapon Fire (R230F)</a>
In each round, all ranged weapons fire before any hand-to-hand attacks are
made. Higher tech ranged weapons always fire before lower tech ones. If
opposing characters have weapons of the same tech level, the one with higher
marksmanship fires first. If both tech level and marksmanship are equal, both
fire at the same time — damage takes effect after both shoot. Note that a
character disabled or killed before he has a chance to attack will be unable
to attack.

### <a name="R230">Hand-to-Hand Combat (R230G)</a>
A person in contact with an opponent can make a hand-to-hand attack. To
determine the result, roll 1d6, add the attacker’s hand-to-hand ability, and
from that subtract the target’s hand-to-hand ability.

If the result is a positive odd number (that is, 1,3,5,7,9 or 11) one hit is
scored, and the target’s endurance is reduced by one.

If the result is “7” exactly, the attacker may disarm the target instead of
inflicting one hit. If this occurs, the attacker takes away from the target
any weapon he or she has. If the target is carrying an item, disabled person,
etc., the attacker can choose to take that instead.

If the result is “9” or “11” exactly, the target is automatically disabled in
addition to suffering a hit.

If Duke Springer is in hand-to-hand combat, before making his attack, he can
make a cunning roll. If he succeeds, he adds 1d6 to his hand-to-hand combat
ability. If he fails, his combat ability is unaffected, but his hand-to-hand
attack occurs last, regardless of when it would normally occur.

### <a name="R230">Sequence of Hand-to-Hand Attacks (R230H)</a>
Hand-to-hand attacks occur after all ranged weapon fire is finished. A
character who fired a ranged weapon cannot make a hand-to-hand attack.
However, a character can change zones and still make a hand-to-hand attack.

When opposing characters are in contact with each other, the character with the
higher hand-to-hand ability attacks first. If both have the same ability, they
attack at the same time.

### <a name="R230">Surprise (R230I)</a>
If a party has surprise in combat (as indicated in the event), the party is
allowed one free round of attacks with ranged weapons. The party can make
hand-to-hand attacks if they start in contact. During this round the opponents
are unable to do anything (being surprised), but those permitted to attack can
undertake all normal activities (including escape, if desired).

### <a name="R230">Escape (R230J)</a>
In a round of combat, you decide to have your party escape. If you decide to
escape, none of the characters in your party can make attacks that round, and
all must attempt to go to the dispersed zone. At the end of the round,
survivors in your party who are neither disabled nor in contact (nor contacted
by) any opponent roll 1d6 for escape. If the result is 4 or higher the escape
is successful, if the result is 3 or less it fails.

If the escape is successful, disabled members of your party, or those in
contact or contacted by the enemy are lost (captured). If you (Duke Springer)
are disabled, in contact, or contacted by the enemy, the escape will fail
instead. The escaped characters are assumed to “hide out” in that area for the
rest of the day, with no further activities allowed.

If the escape fails, there is no special effect, the combat continues as if no
attempt had been made (although your party did “waste” the round of escape, in
that it was unable to fire, etc.).

Escape inside vehicles is possible by exiting the vehicle (abandoning it). It
is impossible to abandon a spaceship in deep space, in orbit, or at an
asteroid, as it means certain death (even if one has a utility suit).

### <a name="R230">Vehicle Combat on Planet (R230K)</a>
When the persons in combat are in vehicles, on either side, all combat is at
the dispersed zone unless the vehicle owner(s) voluntarily elect contact.
Sidearms and heavy hand weapons can be fired from a skimmer (by someone other
than the driver), but not from a ship’s boat or starship. Skimmer guns and
boat guns can be fired by anyone in the vehicle except the driver or pilot.

Personal weapons (sidearms and heavy hand weapons) fired from a skimmer must
add two (+2) to the dice roll for hits if the skimmer is stationary and
permitting contact, otherwise he must add five (+5) to the dice roll. In
either case, the result is to make hits much harder.

Skimmer guns and boat guns must add two (+2) to firing dice rolls unless the
vehicle is stationary and permitting contact.

When firing at a target in a vehicle, the hits are always to the vehicle
itself, rather than the crew. Sidearms only affect skimmers on a critical hit,
and have no effect on a ship’s boat or starship. Heavy hand weapons have full
effect against any target except a starship (on which they have no effect).
Skimmer guns have full effect against any target except a starship, on which
they have no effect. Boat guns (and equivalent military weapons) have full
effect against any target except a starship, where they are treated as
starship guns of one tech level lower than normal (i.e., if the boat guns are
normally tech 4, when firing at a starship they count as tech 3 instead) (see
<a href="#R230">R230</a>L).

*Vehicle Critical Hits*: any critical hit effect on a vehicle is resolved by
roll 1d6 and consulting <a href="#R237">R237</a>. The critical hit is in addition to normal hits.

*Vehicle Damage*: skimmers and other commercial vehicles are immobilized by the
first hit, and destroyed by the second. A ship’s boat is unaffected (aside
from critical hit effects) until the fifth hit, which will destroy it. A
starship is destroyed on the tenth hit.

*Vehicle Escapes*: a party in vehicles that attempts to escape will
automatically succeed if entirely in faster vehicles, and will automatically
fail if entirely in slower vehicles. You can abandon slower vehicles to make
your escape if desired. If both parties have vehicles of equal speed, the
normal escape procedure is used.

Starships are the fastest vehicles present, then ship’s boats, then orbital
shuttles, then skimmers, and finally commercial vehicles. Military and police
vehicles have the speed of their civilian counterpart.

### <a name="R230">Space Combat & Starship Guns (R230L)</a>
Only starships or boat guns can fire at other starships or fight in space
(i.e., in orbit, arriving, or departing from a star system). Due to the great
speeds involved, each combat round is one hour rather than five minutes — it
takes that long because weapons are so inaccurate, despite computer control!

In battle, all space combat is at dispersed zone with ranged weapons. The only
exception is that stationary ships (those with engineering area damaged or
destroyed, or indicated stationary in an event) may be boarded, in which case
individual combat inside the ship can occur instead of space combat.

Starships are considerably faster than ship’s boats. As a result, any round
after the first a starship can elect to “run away” from a ship’s boat, with
the result that all boats immediately drop out of combat. If you leave your
own boat behind during combat, it is automatically lost.

Firing Starship Guns in Space: roll 1d6 for each tech level of the starship
guns. You roll more or fewer dice in special situations, listed below. If you
are reduced to zero dice to roll, a hit is impossible:

* +1d6 roll target is stationary (unwilling or unable to move)
* -1d6 roll firing boat guns
* -1d6 roll target has ECM defenses
* -1d6 roll firing at a target within a planet’s atmosphere

If the combat is occurring in any planetary land area, it is within atmosphere.

*Hit Effects*: if the die roll is “1” or “2” a hit occurs. Note that if more
than one die is rolled, more than one hit could occur. If the target has
defensive screens (present in some events), only a result of “1” means a hit
(2 is a miss). A critical hit occurs if two (or more) “1” results occur,
and/or two (or more) “2” results occur (no effect if the target has screens).
If 1s and 2s both occur, and the target has no screens, two critical hits
occur.

Each normal hit does one hit of damage on the target. After ten (10) normal
hits a starship is destroyed. Each critical hit effect requires an extra 1d6
roll, and <a href="#R237">R237</a> consulted for special effects.

Note: if a starship or boat has both a pilot and gunner, the vehicle can both
move and fire at the same time. If it has only one, it can either move or
fire, but not both.

#### Escaping Space Combat
There are only two ways of escaping starship combat in a spaceship or ship’s
boat. First, you can escape with a hyperjump (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A) — impossible for a boat.
Second, you can hide on an asteroid, if you are currently “in orbit” in the
asteroid belt (<a href="#R206">R206</a>). To hide, select one of the asteroids to hide, and move
there. Each pursuer then rolls 1d6, and goes to the asteroid with that number.
If a pursuer arrives at your asteroid, the battle continues, if none arrives,
you have escaped them. You can try to shake off your pursuer again by
returning to orbit and then going again among the asteroids. This represents
the huge size of the asteroid belt and the many hiding places present.

You can also escape space combat by landing the starship or boat in any area
(including a space station) and leaving it. Unfortunately, this results in the
automatic destruction of the starship or boat.

#### Starship Guns Firing on Planet
Starship guns can be used on planet in normal battles. Since they are computer
controlled, the marksmanship of the firer is not used — instead, they have an
automatic marksmanship of six (6) whenever any qualified starship gunner
operates them. Hits are determined using the normal combat procedure (<a href="#R230">R230</a>D),
but if they hit, the result is automatically equivalent to 10 hits on an
individual, or 1d6 hits and a critical hit on a vehicle. Note that as a
result, a hit by starship guns will normally kill a person, and usually knocks
out vehicles.

## <a name="R231">R231 Wounds & Endurance</a>
Every person has a number of Endurance points (<a href="#R201">R201</a>A). This determines how many
hits the person can take. Each hit reduces a person’s endurance by one (-1),
if endurance reaches zero (0) the person will die unless he receives immediate
emergency first aid (<a href="#R231">R231</a>B). If endurance drops below 0, the person dies
instantly, even if first aid is available. A person can also become disabled
in combat. This means the person is knocked unconscious for the rest of the
combat, but is otherwise unaffected. A disabled person can be carried away by
friends. If you are disabled in combat, make a cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>). If
successful, any other survivors in your party will try to escape, carrying you
with them. If a failure, the rest of your party will abandon you, they
disappear from the game, and you have lost the battle as well.

Hits suffered in combat heal at the rate of one hit per day spent in RRR
(<a href="#R203">R203</a>B). Of course, a person cannot heal beyond his or her normal endurance
level. Recovery from a disablement occurs automatically at the end of combat,
no RRR is needed.

### <a name="R231">Medical Centers & Accelerated Healing (R231A)</a>
A wounded person in an area with a Medical Center can pay for accelerated
healing at the center. At a base cost of 15 S per hit in a city medical
center, or 25 S per hit in a colony medical center, any number of hits can be
healed in one day of RRR. Of course, finances may limit the healing you can
purchase! Colony medical centers in star systems with a Tech code of 20 or
less cannot heal more than three (3) hits per day, regardless of what you pay,
due to limited facilities.

### <a name="R231">Emergency First Aid (R231B)</a>
Emergency first aid is needed to prevent death if a character is at zero (0)
endurance exactly. Emergency first aid is received if the person has a PS
robot (<a href="#R222">R222</a>C) attached, or a medic is present and on the round after the
emergency occurs spends his/her entire time giving first aid. Emergency first
aid must continue uninterrupted until healing allows the person to regain at
least one endurance point, or the person will die after all.

### <a name="R231">Calling Medical Aid (R231C)</a>
Using the radio/communicator available in any starship or ship’s boat, on a PS
robot, or in any land area with life support, you can call for medical aid.
You cannot call if you are “wanted” in the system (<a href="#R228">R228</a>). Medical aid provides
immediately emergency first aid at the scene, and immediate transportation to
the nearest medical center in the star system.

To determine the cost of medical aid, count the number of land areas from your
position to the nearest medical center. Ignore land steps, simply count areas.
If the center is on another planet, count to any spaceport or colony on this
planet, and then count one more area to a spaceport (or colony) on the other
planet. For each area of distance, multiply by the base cost by three. Thus
one area away costs three times (3x) the base price, two areas away costs nine
times (3x3x), three areas away 27 times (3x3x3x), etc. If you cannot pay for
emergency aid, you are discharged from the medical center after one hit heals
and become “wanted” in that system until the debt is paid at any bank in the
system (as a result, you could be arrested, etc., and never have a chance to
pay later, even if you have the money!).

When being transported to a medical center by this method, normal entry
encounters are ignored. However, the medical aid group will only transport the
person who needs healing, not his friends, vehicles, etc.

## <a name="R232">R232 Record Keeping</a>
You will need to keep various records during the play of Star Smuggler. In
fact, use of metal miniatures, markers, play money, and other aids typical to
role-playing games will greatly help. Feel free to make up markers as you need
them during the game. Generally, the records should include:

1. The current location of yourself, your vehicles, and your party (if isolated from you).
1. Characteristics of yourself and your hirelings (<a href="#R201">R201</a>), including hits from combat, etc.
1. Cost of salaries (<a href="#<a href="#R220">R220</a>">R220</a>A), insurance (R220B), and personal property of hirelings.
1. Your money (<a href="#R232">R232</a>A), and payment record on your starship loan (<a href="#R203">R203</a>E). Also note any other special debts,  money deposited (and which system the bank is located in), etc.
1. Whether you or any of your party are “wanted” in any star system, and the identification papers (including forgeries) available for all (<a href="#R228">R228</a>).
1. Location and contents of each cache of items (<a href="#R229">R229</a>C).
1. List of each vehicle, and the equipment in it, including the location of each item, its tech level (<a href="#R210">R210</a>), and  whether it has any damage or is broken down. This should include fuel units (FUs), repair units (RUs), and life  support units (LSUs), as well as number of hypercharges remaining in the starship itself. This should also  include items in cargo.

### <a name="R232">Monetary System (R232A)</a>
The entire Pavonis sector uses a standard currency, technically called Sector
Exchange Units, commonly called “Secs” and normally abbreviated “S.” All
prices are calculated in Secs unless an event specifically indicates you can
trade or barter. Prices vary from system to system for the same item, normally
the base price is given and the actual price must be computed (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A,
multiplier table <a href="#R241">R241</a>).

#### Banks
Whenever you are in an area with banking facilities (<a href="#R205">R205</a>) you can deposit or
withdraw money in a bank account at no charge. However, each bank account is
opened and used with a specific set of identification papers. Forged papers
are not detected upon deposit, but will be detected upon withdrawal unless you
succeed with a Cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>). If you become “wanted” in a system, all
accounts in that name are frozen and no withdrawals are possible.

You can have a bank pay certain fees or policies (starship loan payments, death
insurance, etc.) at some specified future time However, a bank requires that
money must be deposited into the account for this, plus a 10% extra charge
paid for the service (at the time of deposit).

Banks do not communicate from one star system to another. Each star system has
a separate bank. As a result, you may have many separate accounts in various
star systems, as well as different accounts (under different names) in the
same star system.

#### Money Handling
In addition to bank accounts, you can also carry money on your person, in your
starship (the money, regardless of amount, takes up 1 CU of space), and/or
place it in a cache (<a href="#R229">R229</a>C). Spending or receiving money takes no time, but
you must actually hand over cash for any purchase. Signed checks, bank drafts,
etc., cannot be used — nobody trusts such things in the Pavonis sector! Of
course, whenever making a transaction in an area where you have a bank
account, you can make an instant withdrawal from your account for the amount
needed and pay that. Banking facilities, if available, presume
computer controlled accounts and instant access “money machines” on virtually
every street corner!

## <a name="R238">R238 Entry Detection Table</a>
Determine detection factor from the table below, add or subtract to it
depending on the area you are entering, then roll 1d6; entry is not detected
if roll is greater than factor; entry is detected if roll is less than or
equal to factor; If your entry is detected, see <a href="#R233">R233</a> — for complete rules, see

## <a name="R328">R328 Rumors of Entry</a>
You hear rumors of how to sneak into someplace. Select any one land area on the
planet now, and note this. If you succeed with a Cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>) you can
determine its truth now, otherwise, determine it when you attempt entry of
that area. To determine if the rumor is true, roll 1d6. A result of 1-3 means
it is not true, 4-6 means it is true. If the rumor is true, add one (+1) to
your die roll when checking Entry Detection (rule <a href="#R225">R225</a>, table <a href="#R238">R238</a>). You can
continue to use this advantage until your entry is detected, at which point
this advantage is no longer good.

## <a name="R329">R329 Map for Entry</a>
You come across a map that seems to show a way to get into a land area on
planet without detection (select now any one land area on the planet as this
area). When you attempt entry of that area, you can use this map route. If you
do, roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Excellent information, add three (+3) to detection die roll (<a href="#R225">R225</a>), and may continue to add it until you are  detected entering this area. |
|  2  | Good information, add two (+2) to detection die roll (<a href="#R225">R225</a>), and may continue to add it until you are detected entering this area. |
|  3  | Fair information, add one (+1) to detection die roll (<a href="#R225">R225</a>), and may continue to add it until you are detected entering this area. |
|  4  | Route has an unmarked trap, you are not detected, but instead see <a href="#E059">E059</a> if on foot, <a href="#E077">E077</a> if in a vehicle. |
| 5-6 | Map is wildly inaccurate, makes you look foolish and conspicuous, subtract one (-1) from detection die  roll (<a href="#R226">R226</a>). |

Note: Detection procedure (<a href="#R225">R225</a>) normally references table <a href="#R238">R238</a>.

## <a name="R330">R330 Bribe for Entry (Base Price 25 S)</a>
You learn the name of whom to bribe for entering one area (you now select the
area) on this planet. When you actually enter that area, determine the precise
size of bribe needed by multiplying base price by the factor obtained from
table <a href="#R241">R241</a>. By paying this bribe, you are assured of entering the area without
detection (do not roll for detection or an entry encounter as normally
required by <a href="#R225">R225</a>).

## <a name="R331">R331 Opportunity to Buy Items (Base Price 50 S)</a>
You come across an interesting deal. Roll 1d6 and see list below for the exact
type of item available. For each unit listed below, determine actual price by
using rule <a href="#R229">R229</a>A and table <a href="#R241">R241</a>. You can buy as many of the item as you can
afford.

| D6  | Result                                                                 |

## <a name="R332">R332 Opportunity to Buy Items (Base Price 100 S)</a>
You come across an interesting offer. Roll 1d6 and see the list below for the
exact type of item available. For each unit listed below, determine actual
price by using rule <a href="#R229">R229</a>A and table <a href="#R241">R241</a>. You can buy as many of the item as
you can afford.

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Container of radioactives, 4 CU per container. If present in any combat, or in compartment that is hit in combat, the radioactives leak and will inflict one hit per hour for each person in the compartment or vehicle. The radioactives themselves are unaffected and still salable at half price. The contaminated area can be cleaned up at any spaceport, space station, or colony for 5 S per container that was present. |
|  2  | Jar of rare spices, 1 CU per jar.                                      |
|  3  | Stolen art works, 1 CU per work.                                       |
|  4  | Cut gems, every 20 or fraction thereof takes up 1 CU.                  |
|  5  | Young slaves, 1 CU each and highly illegal everywhere. Requires continual life support or dies and becomes totally worthless. |
|  6  | Antique sidearms, 1 CU each. These will fire, but each time roll 1d6, sidearm explodes on “6” and inflicts 1d6 hits on user. If it fires correctly, consider it a normal Tech level 1 weapon. |

## <a name="R333">R333 Opportunity to Buy Items (Base Price 2d6 x 100 S)</a>
You have the opportunity to buy the specific item mentioned below. Roll 1d6 to
determine which item. You can only buy one. Actual cost is determined by using
rule <a href="#R229">R229</a>A and table <a href="#R241">R241</a>.

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A complete set of papers for a starship and a starship pilot (<a href="#R228">R228</a>). The papers are a good quality forgery, and take up no CU. |
|  2  | A set of blueprints for a new type of robot, not yet available. These prints can be sold for double the base price in any other star system with Tech code 20 to 60 (determine actual selling price, based on doubled base price, using <a href="#R229">R229</a>A and <a href="#R241">R241</a>). Blueprints take up 1 CU of space. |
|  3  | A vintage land vehicle that no longer functions, but is an interesting collector’s item. The vintage vehicle takes up 10 CU. It may be offered for sale at any palace. When you do, see ((<a href="#R333">R333</a>A)) |
|  4  | Software for the military radar computers of this star system. You can attempt to sell them at any military base in any other star system. When you do, see (<a href="#R333">R333</a>B). Software takes up 1 CU of space. |
|  5  | Magnificent hypno-gem, that reveals incredible beauty to the viewer, but is very additive to use. Where laws against addictive drugs exist, this gem is illegal. You must locate an addict to sell it, but will make a grand profit if you do so. Gem in case takes 1 CU. |
|  6  | A Mark III mining mole, complete with spare bearings. This may be sold in any mining area off this planet for a base price of triple the base price for purchase, with actual price determined by <a href="#R229">R229</a>A and <a href="#R241">R241</a>. The mole occupies 12 CU. You may reserve the mole for your own use, but this will consume the spare bearings, and halve (1/2) the final selling price. In use, the mole is similar to a skimmer, with an internal capacity of 6 CU. However, it can move underground at the same speed you can walk on foot. If used underground to enter an area, treaty as entry on foot with one added (+1) on the Entry Detection die roll (table <a href="#R238">R238</a>). The maximum speed of the mole is walking on foot, treat riders in it as equivalent to foot speed. It requires one FU per day to run, but has a complete life support system inside that runs whenever fuel is being used. Any qualified skimmer driver can drive the mole. Skimmer guns can be mounted on the mole. |

add two (+2) to the die roll. Results higher than “6” are still considered “6.”

| D6 | Result                                                               |

# Events

## <a name="E001">E001 The Adventure Begins (takes 0 hours)</a>
Due to bad luck and loan sharks, your financial situation is getting very
desperate. Your small merchant starship never seems to have a full cargo hold,
but operating costs are high. Your cash is almost gone, and another payment is
due to the sector financiers. Maybe, just maybe, you can make ends meet if you
look for illegal goods, and begin to take chances.

Consult <a href="#R201">R201</a>B to determine your starting attributes, and your skills, for your
new career as a Star Smuggler, then continue reading here:

You have a sturdy and reliable Antelope class starship (<a href="#R212">R212</a>) built to tech
level 1 standards (<a href="#R210">R210</a>) and outfitted with a Hopper class ship’s boat (<a href="#R214">R214</a>)
and starship guns (<a href="#R216">R216</a>A), both also tech level 1. The starship has six
Hypercharges (<a href="#R212">R212</a>B) and the boat has 15 fuel units (FUs, <a href="#R211">R211</a>). In addition,
a stasis unit (<a href="#R212">R212</a>E) is mounted in the pilot’s compartment with 2 CU
capacity, to protect the occupants in case of disaster. You personally own a
utility suit (<a href="#R213">R213</a>) and a sidearm (<a href="#R216">R216</a>D), both of tech level 1. Your only
money is in your pocket: 1d6 times 100, plus 150 Secs (for example, a 1d6 roll
of “3” means 3x100, then +150, or 450 Secs, see <a href="#R232">R232</a>A).

You have no crew or hirelings, no cargo, and no repair units. However, you do
have proper papers and are not “wanted” in any system (<a href="#R228">R228</a>). This is the
first day of the week, so you have 10 days until your next starship payment is
due (<a href="#R203">R203</a>E).

You are currently at the sole planet in the Regari system (<a href="#R207">R207</a>A) of the
Pavonis sector, at the spaceport (<a href="#R205">R205</a>O). This morning you decide to take up a
life of smuggling. You check over your starship guns and personal sidearm, and
prepare to find profit through any means. See <a href="#R203">R203</a> for the activities
available to you.

## <a name="E002">E002 Repossession Team (takes 1 hour)</a>
A repossession team is in the area. Ignore this event (they’re after someone
else!) unless you have defaulted on your loan (<a href="#R203">R203</a>E) and your starship is in
this area. If they’re after you, the following occurs:

The team of six men surround the spaceship. One is a mobile attorney (<a href="#E5">E5</a>, M0,
H4) with repossession writs, two are heavy gunners (<a href="#E8">E8</a>, M6, H3) with explosive
heavy hand weapons of tech 6, and three are bodyguards (<a href="#E9">E9</a>, M2, H6) with tech
6 sidearms. They are deployed for battle and in the first round open fire on
the starship, one heavy hand gunner at the airlock, the other at the cargo
hold hatch, from dispersed range. They know their business, and will blast
either open with any hit. They will then try to board the ship and take
control either of the engineering or pilot compartment (possible if they are
the only persons in either compartment). They will escort off the ship anyone
who surrenders, but will attempt to kill anyone who fights them or attempts to
remain on board. If they succeed, they gain control of the ship, force all
other persons off it with whatever they can carry - you lose your starship.

## <a name="E003">E003 Armored Vehicles (takes 1 hour)</a>
You are attacked by armored military vehicles, see <a href="#R311">R311</a>. Determine tech level
(<a href="#R210">R210</a>) with table <a href="#R235">R235</a>, and then roll 1d6 to determine the exact composition of
the force:

| D6  | Result                             |
|-----|------------------------------------|
| 1-3 | one vehicle and three infantrymen  |
| 4-5 | two vehicles and four infantrymen  |
| 6   | three vehicles and six infantrymen |

Each infantryman is <a href="#E6">E6</a>, M4, H3. Each vehicle has heavy armor, reducing hit
results by two (that is, a single or double hit becomes a miss, a triple hit
becomes a single hit, etc.), and is armed with a boat gun (<a href="#R230">R230</a>K). Each
vehicle has a crew of three, a driver, gunner, and commander (each <a href="#E6">E6</a>, M3 with
sidearms), who only leave the tank if it is disabled, and then will attempt to
flee. If you defeat the tank(s) but don’t destroy them, you can capture and
repair them. A tank functions like a skimmer (<a href="#R215">R215</a>C), with the following
variations: it takes up 45 CU space, has a capacity of 6 CU for crew and
cargo, plus 6 CU of fuel, which it consumes at the rate of 2 FU per day. It
moves at half the speed of a skimmer, and therefore is slower than anything
other than walking on foot.

Private use of a tank is illegal in all systems, but having it in cargo (not in
use) is allowed if weapons are allowed. If you use the tank as a vehicle to
enter any area, and are detected (<a href="#R238">R238</a>) immediately see <a href="#E018">E018</a> if there are any
military areas on the planet, otherwise see <a href="#E017">E017</a>, ignore normal detection
events. If you are not detected, proceed normally. If you later get into any
combat and use the tank, you will become “wanted” in the system if any of your
opponents escape the battle alive.

## <a name="E004">E004 Plague Carriers (takes rest of day)</a>
You have come in contact with diseased people carrying the plague. For each
person in your party roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                             |
|-----|------------------------------------|
| 1-3 | no disease                         |
| 4-6 | contract the plague                |

Persons who catch the plague lose one Endurance point each day. A PS robot
(<a href="#R222">R222</a>C) cannot stop this, but a medic (<a href="#R221">R221</a>F) who rolls 5-6 on 1d6 can prevent
it, and can treat anyone in the party but himself. To cure the plague once
contracted, the person must either survive one week of its effect or receive
medical treatment (<a href="#R231">R231</a>A). Once cured, normal RRR (<a href="#R203">R203</a>C) or medical treatment
(<a href="#R231">R231</a>A) is needed to regain lost endurance. Once you survive the plague, you
are thereafter immune to it. As long as anyone in your party has the plague,
all those who don’t yet have it, and aren't yet immune must check once a day
to see if they get the disease.

## <a name="E005">E005 Robot Caravan (takes 0 hours)</a>
You see a caravan of robots, composed of one controller robot and 1d6+1 utility
robots (<a href="#R222">R222</a>B). Roll 1d6 to determine what they are carrying:

| D6  | Result                                                        |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | nothing                                                       |
| 2   | 3 FU per U-robot                                              |
| 3   | 3 RU per U-robot                                              |
| 4   | 3-LSU per U-robot                                             |
| 5   | 3 CU of luxury foodstuffs (base value 5 S per CU) per U-robot |
| 6   | 3 CU of refined ore (base value 10 S per CU) per U-robot      |

You can ignore them, or you can disable the controller robot and capture the
caravan (disabling is easily done, as the robot can’t fight back!). (See <a href="#R211">R211</a>
for FU, RU, etc.) If you disable the controller and capture it, the event
takes 1 hour and roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                             |
|-----|------------------------------------|
| 1   | <a href="#E117">E117</a>                               |
| 2   | <a href="#E017">E017</a>                               |
| 3   | <a href="#E059">E059</a>                               |
| 4   | <a href="#E117">E117</a>                               |
| 5   | <a href="#E017">E017</a>                               |
| 6   | no effect                          |

You can repair a disabled controller and reprogram it for your own use by a
Starship Engineer using an RU. The controller is tech 5, costs 4 S per day to
operate, and guides utility robots along a preplanned route using a radio and
automatic alarm signals. You can use it to move goods or food from area to
area, but it, and any U-robots with it, will be lost if their entry is
detected and they are unaccompanied. A functioning controller robot can be
sold at any Mining or Industrial area for base price of 300 S (takes 1 hour to
do).

## <a name="E006">E006 Hit Man (takes 1 hour)</a>
A hit man with a contract on you makes a surprise attack without warning
(<a href="#R230">R230</a>I). He is <a href="#E7">E7</a>, M6, H5 with a tech 6 heavy hand weapon. If he loses 4 or
more endurance, he instantly escapes along a route he pre-planned (you cannot
follow or continue the combat).

## <a name="E007">E007 Government Spy (takes rest of day)</a>
You encounter a spy for some government (you’re not sure which). If you are
carrying any government or military secrets, he will buy them from you for 600
S flat fee if they are for this star system, or 1,500 S if for any other
system. If you have no secrets, he will offer to sell you a set of secret
government documents (for this star system) for 350 S flat fee — they look
genuine, and take up no space.

## <a name="E008">E008 Escaped Prisoners (takes 1 hour)</a>
Your party is suddenly rushed by a group of escaped prisoners. Determine number
of prisoners by a 2d6 roll, each is <a href="#E6">E6</a>, M1, H4 and unarmed, although willing
to use any weapons they can capture. Refer to <a href="#R305">R305</a> for combat. They will
instantly escape if they get a vehicle, otherwise they are trying to take your
clothes, weapons, and other possessions, and will leave if these are given
willingly. You will have to return to your starship or spend 10 S from a local
bank account for new clothes as your next activity.

## <a name="E009">E009 Pheromone Dealer (takes rest of day)</a>
You meet a dealer in pheromones, chemicals that influence the behavior of
others. He tries to sell you 1d6 doses of pheromones for a base price of 80 S
each, and will succeed (he is using pheromones on you) unless you succeed in a
Cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>). If you succeed in the roll, you may buy them or not at
half that price, as you desire. You may use pheromones later in any purchase
or sale, to double or halve the price as you desire. When you use a dose, roll
one die: if the result is 6 the effect reverses (doubles prices instead of
halves, etc.) but you need not complete the transaction. The doses are very
small, you can carry them on your person without requiring any CU space.

## <a name="E010">E010 Industrial Spy (takes rest of day)</a>
You encounter an industrial espionage agent, who is willing to buy or sell
industrial secrets for a base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 500 S. He will only make one
transaction (one purchase, or one sale).

## <a name="E011">E011 Gem Dealer (takes rest of day)</a>
You meet a gem dealer who handles stolen gems and jewelry. He will buy any
amount of such goods (including legal ones, if you have them) for a base price
(<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 1,800 S per CU, and sell any for a base price of 2,000 S per CU. It
is impossible to attack him, since his money and merchandise is held by
another agent (which is why transactions take so long).

## <a name="E012">E012 Royal Party (takes 1 hour)</a>
You encounter a group that includes a member of the royal family and 2d6
bodyguards who ignore you. You, however, may decide to attempt an attack to
kidnap the royal person, if you do, refer to <a href="#R302">R302</a>. Each bodyguard is <a href="#E5">E5</a>, M3,
H4, armed with sidearms (determine tech level per <a href="#R210">R210</a>). If you kill every
bodyguard, the royal prince will surrender to you, the kidnapping is
successful. If you successfully kidnap the prince, on any subsequent day you
can attempt to ransom him (takes no time, but must have access to
communications equipment, and be at his home planet). Roll 1d6 for result:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | negotiations continue, try again tomorrow some time                    |
|  3  | no deal, you get no ransom are are now “wanted” (<a href="#R228">R228</a>) in this system, you can dispose of the prince as you wish (he’s of no further use) |
|  4  | they pay a base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 1000 S for his return                 |
|  5  | they pay a base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 5000 S for his return                 |
|  6  | they offer tons of money, but when you make the exchange (in this area) you are ambushed (see <a href="#R327">R327</a> and subtract one from the dice roll) by 20 men, each <a href="#E8">E8</a>, M6, H5 with heavy hand weapons (see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level); the prince will be killed in the firefight, and you will discover that they did not bring anything but fake money that is totally worthless |

## <a name="E013">E013 Bandits (takes 1 hour)</a>
You are trailed and attacked by a group of bandits. There are 1d6+2 of them,
each is E 1d6+2, M4, H4, armed with sidearms (see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level) refer
to <a href="#R327">R327</a> for the combat situation.

## <a name="E014">E014 Gamblers (takes rest of day)</a>
Several “high roller” gamblers invite you to join a private game. If you agree,
you must go alone, and decide how much money you take. Then roll 1d6 to see
the results of your activities for the day and evening:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | you are attacked by three men, each <a href="#E5">E5</a>, M4, H4 with sidearms (see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level), they demand your money and weapons and will leave with them, if you refuse see <a href="#R327">R327</a> and add one to your dice roll |
|  2  | you have bad luck in the games, lose all the money you brought         |
|  3  | you have poor luck in the games, lose half the money you brought       |
|  4  | if you succeed with a Cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>) you double the money you brought, otherwise you break even |
|  5  | you have good luck and double the money you brought                    |
|  6  | you have excellent luck, if you succeed with a Cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>) you get five times the money you brought, if you fail, you get triple the money you brought |

## <a name="E015">E015 Gunrunner (takes rest of day)</a>
You meet a gunrunner (<a href="#E8">E8</a>, M5, H4) who has a skimmer and a commercial vehicle.
The skimmer has a driver, skimmer guns, and a gunner (<a href="#E7">E7</a>, M4, H5). He also has
three bodyguards (each <a href="#E6">E6</a>, M5, H4) armed with heavy hand weapons. The skimmer
guns are tech 4, for all other items determine tech level (<a href="#R210">R210</a>). If you
decide to attack them, see <a href="#R301">R301</a>. If you damage or destroy the commercial
vehicle roll 1d6 below and get the indicated items free. If you decide to
bargain instead, roll 1d6 and see the list below; you can attack after you
start to bargain, but in that case see <a href="#R230">R230</a>.

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | they will buy any weapons you have, at base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) for 5 S per sidearm, 5 S per tech level for a heavy hand weapon, 40 S for skimmer gun, 400 S for a boat gun |
|  2  | they will sell weapons at the following base prices (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A): tech 3 sidearms for 3 S each, heavy hand weapons (roll for tech level, see <a href="#R210">R210</a>) in 6 CU crates of 5 guns for 40 S per crate |
|  3  | military explosive heavy hand weapons (roll for tech level, see <a href="#R210">R210</a>) for 20 S base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) each |
|  4  | artillery beam weapon for 1500 S, it is tech 3, 8 CU in size, and fires like a starship gun (<a href="#R216">R216</a>A) and thus requires appropriately skilled starship gunner to operate, to fire it must be emplaced on the ground, which takes three men one round, or two men two rounds, firing in battle consumes 1 FU (<a href="#R211">R211</a>) |
|  5  | if your party is on foot, the gunners automatically attack, see <a href="#R304">R304</a>, otherwise they simply offer to buy any sidearms you have for 2 S each |
|  6  | they offer to sell what they claim is an alien weapon of unknown purpose for a base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 600 S, if you buy it, refer to <a href="#E083">E083</a> afterward |

## <a name="E016">E016 Bootlegger (takes rest of day)</a>
You meet a bootlegger who offers you any amount of Kroyxan brandy (with no tax
stamps) at 85 S for each 1 CU case. The unstamped brandy can be sold at any
Gambling area for a base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 200 S per case. You can obtain tax
stamps for the brandy whenever you have the chance to obtain false papers, and
for the same price a set of papers would cost. Properly stamped brandy can be
sold in any City area for 500 S per case or Palace area for 600 S per case,
base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A).

## <a name="E017">E017 Police Try to Capture You (takes rest of day)</a>
You are suddenly confronted by a police special engagement team, trying to
capture you, refer to <a href="#R312">R312</a>. The police team has three skimmers, each with a
driver, skimmer gun and gunner (<a href="#E6">E6</a>, M5, H3) and two troopers (<a href="#E7">E7</a>, M4, H6) with
heavy hand weapons and sidearms. Determine tech level of their equipment in
<a href="#R210">R210</a>. You can surrender and avoid combat, see <a href="#E023">E023</a> immediately. If you are
defeated in combat, see <a href="#E023">E023</a> also, but while there receive medical treatment
for any wounds (<a href="#R231">R231</a>A).

## <a name="E018">E018 Military Patrol (takes 1 hour)</a>
You encounter a military patrol of six men, see <a href="#R324">R324</a>. If a battle occurs,
determine tech level (<a href="#R210">R210</a>) and consult appropriate description below:

| Tech | Patrol                                                                                                        |

|  2   | all six troopers have heavy hand guns.                                |
|  3   | all six have heavy hand guns, two are explosive weapons.              |
|  4   | all six have heavy hand guns, the patrol leader has a dalurium-screen helmet that protects him from any psionic attack, and carries a pack of four frag-grenades. |
|  5   | all six have a heavy hand gun and four frag grenades, three of the six have shimmer-screen that reduces accuracy of weapon fire against it by two (-2) (if captured and it breaks down, it cannot be fixed). |
|  6   | all six have heavy hand gun and four frag grenades except the patrol leader, who instead carries a portable field scrambler, any hit from which causes instant breakdown to a vehicle on a 1d6 roll of 4-6. The scrambler is 2 CU and has no effect on a starship with ECM. |

Frag Grenades: explosive weapons of 3 tech levels below that of the troops
carrying them (reflects their inaccuracy if thrown or fired from grenade
launchers).

Note: if you have a tank, or a ship’s boat that has used boat guns to fire on
planet (and there were any survivors), or a starship that fired its guns on
planet (and there were survivors), the patrol will also have a heavy artillery
weapon, see <a href="#E015">E015</a> result 4 for details of this device.

## <a name="E019">E019 Customs Inspection (takes 1d6 hours)</a>
As you pass through customs, you are delayed by agents looking for anyone
without papers (<a href="#R228">R228</a>), stolen goods, or items illegal in all systems. If you
are in a starship, they will search the ship (<a href="#R229">R229</a>D). If you refuse to pay any
duties (see below), or have anything improper per above, see <a href="#E080">E080</a>. Roll 1d6 as
well, to determine which type of item has duty charges:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | liquor or any type of alcoholic beverage at 5 S per CU                 |
|  2  | any vehicles (including your own ship’s boat, if present, or the starship itself!) at 5 S per vehicle |
|  3  | any robots at 10 S per robot                                           |
|  4  | any type of ore, at 2 S per CU                                         |
|  5  | any living animals or plants are contraband and will be automatically confiscated, there is no charge, and they are permanently lost |
|  6  | any radioactives at 10 S per CU                                        |

## <a name="E020">E020 Payment on Arrival (takes 1 hour)</a>
When you reach New Karma spaceport, space station or colony with the gypsies,
roll 1d6. If you receive any rubies, they can be sold at list value to any gem
dealer you encounter, or bartered at half their value for anything in lieu of
normal money payments. Rubies cannot be deposited in a bank account. Die roll
results are:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | clan leader gives you a sack of rubies with a value of 53,000 S        |
|  2  | clan leader admits he doesn’t have that many rubies, but gives you a small sack with a value of 8,000 S |
| 3-6 | the clan leader says one of the children has a broken arm (he does), suffered in your rough landing — since the clan did not arrive all in good condition, you violated the agreement and he’ll pay nothing, even if you threaten them or search them at gunpoint, you will find no more rubies, and in fact no money at all! |

## <a name="E021">E021 Palatek Inspection (takes rest of day)</a>
The Palatek inspection team searches for any items you obtained from Industrial
or Scientific areas. If in your starship, see <a href="#R229">R229</a>D, otherwise they search
every person and vehicle in your party. All such items they find are taken and
held in custody at the space station (or in an orbiting mother ship) for
further examination. It is obvious from their strength that resistance is
impossible, although if in your starship, you can hyperjump and then easily
kill the few poorly armed men on board (see <a href="#R212">R212</a>C). Items taken for inspection
will be returned after a number of days equal to their tech level, and
meanwhile you will be required to attend classes instructing you in the laws
of the Palatek system. You learn that industrial espionage is punishable by
death, as are numerous infringements of the rights of corporations. On the
other hand, crimes against individual persons do not seem to entail serious
punishments.

## <a name="E022">E022 Psionic Attacks (take no time)</a>
Only psionicists may make psionic attacks. A special procedure is used:

1. Choose the size of the attack, from 1 to 6, and select one person as the
   target.

2. Roll 1d6. If the roll equals or exceeds the attack size, you inflict a
   number of hits to the target equal to the size of the attack. If the roll is
   less than the size of the attack, the attacker takes a number of hits equal
   to the die roll. For wound effects, see <a href="#R231">R231</a>. Psionic attacks occur last in
   the round, and cannot be made if the psionic attacker fired ranged weapons
   or made a hand-tohand attack.

3. The size of the attack is limited by the Psionic Power of the attacker. The
   total of all attack strengths made during a day cannot exceed the psionic
   power of the individual. Special Abilities: a psionicist can use his/her
   power points as defense against psionic attacks, on a non-psionic person, but
   not a psionic person. Each point of power used in defense protects one person
   for one round.

## <a name="E023">E023 Go to Jail (takes rest of day)</a>
You are put in the nearest prison in this system (if none, go to the nearest
City or Colony). You lose all equipment and money. At the start of each day
roll 1d6, subtracting one (-1) if in a City or Colony. A result of “1” means
you escape, any other result means you remain in prison that day. If you
escape, roll 1d6 again for each character in your party, “1” or “2” mean they
escape with you (or rejoin you upon your escape, in which they aided), any
other result means that member of your party has disappeared. If you escape in
an area that lacks good air, you have managed to steal a utility suit. Escape
takes the first hour of the day, you can continue travelling for the remaining
time period. After 1d6 hours this day you will become “wanted” in this system.

## <a name="E024">E024 Ask the Nipnans for Help (takes 1 hour)</a>
If you have personal and ship’s papers (<a href="#R228">R228</a>), are not “wanted” in this system
(<a href="#R228">R228</a>), and do not have any items purchased on Mynkuria, the Nipnans help
extricate your ship and you are free to proceed. Any crewman with you but
without papers is arrested and lost. Otherwise, with their overwhelming force
of warships, they confiscate everything you own, including your starship and
cargo, and put you and your crew in jail, see <a href="#E023">E023</a>. Boy, you really blew it
this time!

## <a name="E025">E025 Buy Starship Hypercharges (takes rest of day)</a>
You can buy hypercharges and install them in your starship. They cannot be
stored as cargo or otherwise transported. Each hypercharge has a standard cost
of 500 S.

You can buy an Antelope class starship (<a href="#R212">R212</a>) for 120,000 S cash. You cannot
buy one on credit, since your credit is now bad (start a new game if you want
to do that!). The starship comes with no cargo, no crew, no starship guns, and
only one Hypercharge, although you are free to buy more at 500 S each. The
starship comes with all normal ship’s papers (<a href="#R228">R228</a>) unless you are “wanted.”
If you’re wanted, you can get the ship, but without papers (it is bought
illegally). Note that the starship does not come with a ship’s boat. Determine
tech level of the starship using <a href="#R210">R210</a>. It may not be tech 1 (as was your
original Antelope class)!

he must travel outside of his home area, for each area he must travel to the
repair site the salary doubles (moving to a neighboring area will cost you 10
S per day, two areas away 20 S per day, etc.). He will not leave the planet,
but will go up to a space station (but not to orbit). If he leaves his home
area you must provide repair units for the work; if he works in his home area,
you can provide them, or have him use his own, which cost you an extra 5 S
each. Mobile repairmen will arrange for their own transportation, you need not
provide it.

## <a name="E070">E070 Radioactive Area (takes no time)</a>
You are in a radioactive area. Everyone present immediately suffers one hit,
with one addition during each hour you remain in this area. Each vehicle or
piece of equipment in the area must check for break-down (<a href="#R218">R218</a>) after each
hour, in addition to checking at the end of the day.

## <a name="E071">E071 Gambling (takes rest of day)</a>
You may place one bet, of any size, using Sees (S) of cash only. Next roll 2d6
to see what you win back: any roll of doubles wins back your initial bet. A
roll of 5 or 9 means you win twice your bet, 3 or 11 means you win triple your
bet. Alternately, you can play the “jackpot” game where you make your bet,
roll 2d6, and collecting nothing unless a “12” occurs — where you win thirty
times (30x) your initial bet. You must select your game and pay your bet, then
roll the dice. You can continue to play game after game of Gambling for as
long as you wish, or until you run out of cash. If you end this activity with
1,000 S or more in your pocket, roll 1d6 and consult the appropriate event:

Hirelings working in a mine require double normal salary due to dangers and difficulty of the work, and will need a successful Cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>) by you each subsequent week (can make one roll for all, or deal with them individually, as you desire). U Robots can also work it if directed by yourself or a controller (available only through events) which was reprogrammed for the job (requires repair work <a href="#R219">R219</a> to reprogram). Robots in the mine must roll twice after each day for break-down (<a href="#R218">R218</a>). |

## <a name="E073">E073 “Wanted” Person Recognized (takes 1 hour)</a>
Ignore this event if nobody is “wanted” in your party. Anyone (including you)
in your party who is “wanted” (<a href="#R228">R228</a>) in this system is recognized. Instantly
1d6+1 guards appear demanding surrender of all wanted persons. Each guard is
E 1d6+1, M 1d6, H 1d6 with a heavy hand weapon (<a href="#R216">R216</a>D). You can surrender the
wanted person(s), who goes to jail (<a href="#E023">E023</a>); or you can fight. If you fight, see
<a href="#R327">R327</a> and subtract one (-1) from your dice roll there.

## <a name="E074">E074 Commercial Transport Available (if not timed, takes 1 hour)</a>
You may hire commercial transport (<a href="#R215">R215</a>B). This may be a commercial vehicle, or
an orbital shuttle if at a space station, space port, or colony on a planet
without a spaceport. Every 3 CU capacity hired costs 1 S per hour, regardless
of whether it is moving or waiting, and comes with fuel and driver. Entire
rental time must be paid in advance, vehicle disappears after that. Travel
speeds are given in <a href="#R203">R203</a>A. If hiring a commercial vehicle, each comes in one
of three sizes, either a 3 CU, 6 CU or 9 CU vehicle. You can hire more than
one, but larger vehicles do not exist. Any size orbital shuttle is available.

## <a name="E075">E075 Open Laboratory (takes 1 hour)</a>
You find an open door to a laboratory area in the scientific complex. You may
enter and spend another 1d6 hours looking around. If you do, then roll a 1d6
for the results of your searches:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | find nothing of obvious value                                          |
|  2  | knock over a shelf of chemicals that explode, you clumsy oaf! roll 2d6, 2-7 is that many hits, 8-12 is disablement, with an additional roll for each additional person in your party — you then recover and escape |
|  3  | find valuable scientific plans, can be sold for 1,000 S base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) in any scientific area of any other star system |
|  4  | set off alarms, immediately roll for an entry encounter (<a href="#R225">R225</a>A) complex with normal minus, one (-1) to die roll for this area |
|  5  | find a file cabinet with useful information, may take file for any one piece of equipment — information allows a starship engineer to spend a day in RRR tinkering with that item to improve it by one tech level |
|  6  | accidentally activate a quantum discombobulator, immediately roll for breakdown (<a href="#R218">R218</a>) of each item of equipment with your party, must escape immediately and thus abandon anything you cannot carry out immediately |

## <a name="E076">E076 Street Dealer (takes 1 hour)</a>
A rather seedy looking individual approaches and says he has just the deal for
you, if you will come alone with him. If you do, event takes the rest of the
day, and roll 1d6 for the result:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | you are offered four cases of stolen hand computers, each is 5 S base price and is 4 CU in size |
|  2  | you are offered pure dylaweed extract at 25 S per CU                   |
|  3  | you are offered one night of absolute delight for 3 S                  |
|  4  | you are offered a stolen collection of rare illustrated books for 10 S, they take up 2 CU of space |
|  5  | you are jumped by three men, each <a href="#E6">E6</a>, M4, H5 with side-arms (see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level), one will begin in contact, attacking, see <a href="#R305">R305</a> |
|  6  | you are offered counterfeit money up to 5,000 S face value, each 100 S of fake money will cost you 10 S of your real money. |

For details on base price in purchase and resale, see <a href="#R229">R229</a>A. If you buy any of
the above items, you can attempt resale by spending an hour in any city area
and making a successful cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>). Base price at resale is 1d6+6
times the purchase price. However, if you fail the cunning roll when-trying to
resell the first item, it means they are really worthless — you’ve been ripped
off for the entire value of the item.

Fake money can be used at face value as long as you make successful cunning
rolls (<a href="#R202">R202</a>). The first time you fail, though, you instantly become “wanted”
in that system. Fake money cannot be given to any bank, they will instantly
recognize that its fake, regardless of your cunning.

## <a name="E077">E077 Vehicular Trap (takes no time)</a>
You run into a trap designed to stop your vehicle. Roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | the vehicle suffers that many hits of damage (<a href="#R217">R217</a>)                    |
| 3-5 | it suffers an immediate break-down but not hits                        |
|  6  | the trap malfunctions and has no effect upon your vehicle              |

## <a name="E078">E078 Proceed Through Mines (takes 1 hour per mine)</a>
You start by seeing two mines that must be passed, it takes one hour of careful
maneuvering to try to pass each. After each, roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | back up and try again                                                  |
| 2-4 | pass by successfully, go on to next                                    |
|  5  | a ship’s boat passing through is successful, but a starship explodes the mine and suffers 2d6 hits (reduce result by 2 if ship has activated defensive screens) |
|  6  | pass this mine successfully, but there are two more beyond, add them to the number you must pass to get out of the field. |

If mine damage destroys your starship, or your decide to abandon it, you can
leave in the ship’s boat. If the ship is destroyed, only people on board and
what they can carry get into the boat (plus whatever is already there and not
thrown out to make room). If the ship isn’t yet destroyed, cargo, etc. can
also be loaded into the boat as space permits.

## <a name="E079">E079 Attack the Drone (takes 1 hour/round)</a>
The drone is a masterpiece of Nipnan technology. It is tech level 6 with ECM
and defensive screens. See <a href="#R230">R230</a>L for combat rules. You fire first, and any hit
destroys the drone. If you miss, it makes an “attack run” as if firing tech 6
starship guns. If it hits, the drone itself detonates on your ship, causing
1d6+1 hits. If it misses, you can either hyperjump, try to escape via sublight
drive (see <a href="#E132">E132</a>), or fight another round.

## <a name="E080">E080 Arrested by Customs (takes 1d6 hours)</a>
The customs officers arrest any members of your crew without papers, and arrest
you for various violations or your refusal to pay duty. If you are involved
and surrender, see <a href="#E023">E023</a>, your starship can be found at the spaceport, space
station, or colony (in that order, depending on the world), with the rest of
your equipment and any crew whose salaries are still paid up. If you decide to
resist, see <a href="#R301">R301</a> for the battle situation. There are two men in Contact with
you, and two more men in your vehicle, all are <a href="#E5">E5</a>, M4, H6 armed with sidearms.
If you succeed in killing them, the customs post itself has a starship gun
(see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level) with gunner in a turret-area protected like a
starship and is inaccessible to boarding, but also immobile.

## <a name="E081">E081 Attack or Escape the Battleship (takes 1 hour/round)</a>
The starship battle procedure must be used, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>L. Each round you will
shoot first. Determine if you hit, and if you are trying to escape by moving
away. Then, roll 1d6 to determine the battleship’s response, subtracting three
if trying to escape:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | (or less) the battleship opens fire with all guns, but if you’re moving away you then escape |
|  2  | the battleship fires with 2d6 of its guns, then engages its sublight drive and moves away from you too fast to follow, battle ends |
|  3  | the battleship fires with 1d6 guns, then engages its sublight drive and moves away from you too fast to follow, battle ends |
|  4  | battleship does not fire, but engages sublight drive and moves away, battle ends - however, you are now “wanted” (<a href="#R228">R228</a>) in this system |
|  5  | if your shot missed, roll again, if it hit, the battleship appears heavily damaged, secondary explosions appear on board, and then it erupts in a massive explosion and is destroyed without ever firing back |
|  6  | the battleship surrenders, you board and in the rest of the day discover that there is only a skeleton crew on board, you decide to ransom the battleship back to the Imperian government for 2d6 times 10,000 S and are paid immediately |

Battleship Statistics: the battleship is tech 2, mounts 12 tech 2 star-ship
guns, and has 120 hit points. Note that it may not fire all its guns at once.

## <a name="E082">E082 Board Alien Ship (concludes the game)</a>
It is obvious that this is a very old, alien starship. As your boarding party
moves about the ship, investigating mysterious devices and controls, one
person accidentally triggers a panel and power suddenly comes on. The
automatic collision-avoidance field energizes, propelling your own starship
away so violently that it is crushed and everyone on board is killed. Your
boarding party is now trapped on the alien ship. If it includes a starship
engineer, you will be able to learn to operate the engines and take the ship
in to harbor for instant victory due to the fame and wealth involved. If you
don’t have a starship engineer with you on board, you’ll never learn how to
operate the ship, and will starve to death unless you can enter a stasis unit
(if you do, see <a href="#R240">R240</a>).

## <a name="E083">E083 Alien Weapon (takes 1 hour)</a>
Designate one person to try to operate the alien weapon, and roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | item turns out to be an alien musical instrument, not a weapon, which you can sell in any scientific area for 30 S base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) |
|  2  | item turns out not to be an alien artifact, but a modern sculpture produced at a local art school |
|  3  | item turns out not to be an alien artifact, but a prop from a science fiction holo-movie (albeit a very realistic one!) |
|  4  | it explodes, destroying itself and inflict 2d6 hits on the person who tried it |
|  5  | it is an alien weapon, a pigment disruptor, fires like a tech 6 sidearm, and any hit turns the victim’s skin color to green or purple and disables by causing blindness that can only be cured at a Medical Center (<a href="#R231">R231</a>), but no other damage -it has no effect on vehicles, if it ever breaks down (<a href="#R218">R218</a>) it cannot be fixed |
|  6  | the alien weapon immediately attunes itself to the brain of the person trying it; the user need merely think of a target in sight, and the weapon will hit that target automatically (one hit only), for break-down purposes consider it a tech 4 weapon (<a href="#R218">R218</a>), if a break-down occurs roll 1d6, on a 5-6 the user becomes insane and the weapon useless, on a 1-4 it can be repaired normally and the user is unaffected. |

## <a name="E084">E084 Building Collapses (takes 1 hour)</a>
As you move through the ruins, an old building collapses on you, unless you
successfully make a Cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>) to avoid it. If you are caught in a
collapse and in a vehicle, the vehicle suffers one hit and is immobilized. It
will take two people the rest of today or one person through the end of
tomorrow to clear it from the rubble, including repairs if anyone in the party
is capable of it (<a href="#R219">R219</a>). If caught in a collapse on foot, each person in the
party suffers 1d6 hits. However, the hits are received one by one, slowly, and
thus utility suits will self-seal after each (although the wearer still loses
the endurance!)(<a href="#R231">R231</a>).

## <a name="E085">E085 Attack by Mutants (takes 1 hour)</a>
A group of 1d6+10 mutants charge out to attack your party, starting at
dispersed range. See <a href="#R327">R327</a> and subtract one (-1) from your dice roll there. The
leader has <a href="#E12">E12</a>, M3, H4 and a tech 2 heavy hand weapon, the others are unarmed
and are each <a href="#E9">E9</a>, M0, H3.

## <a name="E086">E086 Unguarded Office on Military Base (takes 1 hour)</a>
You can slip into an office unseen and search it. If you do so, take 1 more
hour and roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | you find nothing of value                                              |
|  2  | you find two sidearms and one heavy hand weapon (see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level, but add one when rolling to determine result on table <a href="#R235">R235</a>) |
|  3  | you are surprised by an overwhelming force of military police who arrest you and your party unless you succeed with a Cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>), if arrested they take all your possessions and imprison you for 20 days, after which you may attempt to leave once at the start of each 10-day week with a 1d6 result of 4-6, when you leave they will not return what was confiscated, and imprisoned hirelings will leave unless immediately paid any back-salaries due |
|  4  | you find secret defense plans for the base, which you can sell for a base price of 500 S at a military area in another star system (or a base price of 5,000 S if the other star system is at war with this one) |
|  5  | alarms go off! immediately roll for an entry encounter (<a href="#R225">R225</a>A) for a military land area, including the standard subtracting one (-1) from the die roll on the table (<a href="#R239">R239</a>) |
|  6  | two guards, each <a href="#E8">E8</a>, M6, H4 with heavy hand weapons (see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level) challenge you, see <a href="#R323">R323</a> unless on Imperia or Talitar, then see <a href="#R319">R319</a> (20 S). |

## <a name="E087">E087 Prisoner Pleads for Escape (takes 1 hour)</a>
If you are with one or more people as a party, ignore this event. If you are
alone, a prisoner approaches the bars and wall to address you. He says that if
you get him out and take him to any Rural, Rough, or Slum area on Byzantium or
Imperia he can pay you 8,000 S. He is telling the truth on a result of 1-5
with a 1d6 roll. You can determine that now if you make a successful Cunning
roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>), otherwise you don’t find out the truth until you deliver him. If
he is lying, you’ll get nothing for your pains. To get him out takes the rest
of the day, and requires that you disable or kill a guard with <a href="#E7">E7</a>, M 1d6, H5
with a sidearm (see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level). See <a href="#R301">R301</a> for the attack. You then
escape, and will leave this area and enter another as part of the activity
(with an appropriate entry encounter). The former prisoner is “wanted” in this
star system, and is E 1d6, M 1d6, H 1d6+1 (maximum of 6). He is a willing
member of your party until you next reach Byzantium or Imperia.

## <a name="E088">E088 Intact Room in Ruins (takes rest of day)</a>
You find a building with an intact, sealed room. You may examine it if you
wish. If you do, roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | a foul-smelling cloud bursts out as the room is opened, all those not in utility suits are exposed to plague, see <a href="#E004">E004</a> |
|  2  | the room contains a large antique bed of great value, it can be sold at any Palace for a base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 1,100 S, or any City for a base price of 200 S, it occupies 9 CU |
|  3  | you find a set of old religious texts that may be sold at any Colony on New Karma, texts occupy 1 CU, at time of sale roll 1d6 to determine base price: 1-20 S, 2-85 S, 3-175 S, 4-600 S, 5-12,000 S, 6-58,000 S |
|  4  | you have blundered into a trap, see <a href="#E059">E059</a>                               |
|  5  | you are suddenly bombarded with radiation that causes 1d6 hits to each person in the room, if wearing a utility suit, secondary radiation causes double the normal number of hits received |
|  6  | you find a cache of coins worth 30 S                                   |

## <a name="E089">E089 Friendly Psionicist (takes 2 hours)</a>
You meet an intriguing woman who is an accomplished psionicist looking for
adventure. She is bored with life here, and isn’t interested in the military,
since she abhors battle. She says she will join your party on her terms, and
you must agree before you hear the terms. If you succeed in a Cunning roll
(<a href="#R202">R202</a>) you can guess her terms from conversation and consult the paragraph
below before deciding, otherwise you must decide first, then roll 1d6 below.
If you cannot meet the terms she specifies, or later welch on the deal, she
will make a deadly psionic attack on you and escape, resulting in your Cunning
(<a href="#R202">R202</a>) being reduced by 1d6 (if your Cunning falls below zero, consider it
zero instead). Her terms are:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | she works for free, but will neither fire weapons nor fight hand-to-hand |
|  2  | she works for 5 S per day, but will neither fire weapons nor fight hand-to-hand |
|  3  | she works for free, but must be in a stasis unit (<a href="#R212">R212</a>E) with paid-up insurance (<a href="#R220">R220</a>), and will neither fire weapons nor fight hand-to-hand |
|  4  | she works for 3 S per day and will do anything you require             |
|  5  | if you give her a skimmer now, she will work for up to 40 days on this planet, but will neither fire weapons |
|  6  | she will work and do whatever you request if you give her the single most valuable item in your cargo (hidden or not) |

Psionicist’s Abilities: E 1d6+2 (maximum of 7), M 1d6-3 (minimum of 0), H
1d6-1, qualified skimmer driver, psionic power of 1d6+2 (see <a href="#E022">E022</a> for use of
the psionic power in combat). Her presence in your party will add one (+1) to
the Cunning when dealing with anyone except her, and she will use her power to
make psionic attacks, although she will only do so if your party is attacked
first if her employment terms include no weapons use or fighting.

## <a name="E090">E090 Seen But Ignored (takes no time)</a>
A rather dilapidated starship with Regari markings passes you, but makes no
attempt at communication. You may proceed as desired (one hour to go to any
planet or asteroid orbit in the system).

## <a name="E091">E091 Detect Broken-down Starship (takes no time)</a>
You detect a Regari starship which appears to be under repair, with men working
on its hull. It also seems incapable of detecting you — you may proceed as
desired.

## <a name="E092">E092 Passed After Radio Contact (takes no time)</a>
As you enter the system, cursory radio contact is made from a patrol starship.
After a brief conversation, you are passed without incident, and may proceed as desired.

## <a name="E093">E093 No Ships & No Contact (takes no time)</a>
The system might as well be deserted. You detect no nearby starships and there
are no attempts to communicate with you. You may proceed.

## <a name="E094">E094 Minefield (takes no time)</a>
You are at the edge of one of the dreaded Nipnan fields of space mines.
You have four options:

* Immediately hyperjump to another star system (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A);
* Shoot the mines with your starship guns to clear a path, see <a href="#E098">E098</a>;
* Try to cautiously proceed through the mines by sublight drive, see <a href="#E078">E078</a>;
* Stay in place and radio the Nipnans for help, see <a href="#E024">E024</a>.

## <a name="E095">E095 Starship Attacks (takes 1 hour/round)</a>
You are immediately attacked by a starship with Mynkurian markings, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>L.
Before you can do anything (not even engage ECM or defense screens) they fire.
After that, you can hyperjump to another system (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A), stand and fight, or
use sublight drive to run away (results in a running battle, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>L). The
Mynkurian ship will ignore all communication, and continue to fight until you
escape or destroy it. Mynkurian Ship: it is a patrol escort, consult <a href="#R210">R210</a> for
tech level of ship (applies to all its equipment, such as starship guns, as
well). It has one turret of starship guns, 10 hit points, and neither ECM nor
defensive screens.

## <a name="E096">E096 Undetected (takes no time)</a>
You are not detected by any ships in the system, and may proceed to the
destination of your choice.

## <a name="E097">E097 Communications Signal (time varies)</a>
You receive a signal to wait for escort and proceed then to a Palatek Space
Station (or orbit, if no station) at the planet of your destination for an
inspection. If you ignore this signal, or have an inoperative communications
system, no time passes, but see <a href="#E108">E108</a> immediately. If you receive the signal,
you can hyperjump instantly to another system (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A). If you receive the
signal and acknowledge it, you wait 1d6 hours for two Palatek patrol frigates
to approach, take another 4 hrs to escort you to the space station (or orbit),
and there an inspection team boards, see <a href="#E021">E021</a>.

## <a name="E098">E098 Robot Wardrone (time varies)</a>
A Nipnan robot wardrone is approaching very quickly! You can try to immediately
hyperjump to another system (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A), attack the drone — see <a href="#E079">E079</a>, or try to
flee from the drone — see <a href="#E132">E132</a>.

## <a name="E099">E099 Ship’s Boat Approaches (takes 1 hour)</a>
You are approached by a ship’s boat with strange markings. It appears unarmed,
and does not respond to communication attempts. If you decide to attack it,
see <a href="#E161">E161</a>. You can leave the vicinity either by sublight drive or hyperdrive,
leaving the boat behind (it is too slow to pursue). You can wait for it to
approach more closely, if so see <a href="#E169">E169</a>. If you have a psionicist on board, you
may attempt psionic contact, see <a href="#E177">E177</a>.

## <a name="E100">E100 Distress Call (takes no time)</a>
You receive a distress call from a starship in trouble. You may ignore it, and
must if your communications are inoperative — see <a href="#E109">E109</a>. You may move toward
it, spending one hour travelling by sublight drive — see <a href="#E182">E182</a>.

## <a name="E101">E101 Mental Probes (takes no time)</a>
You feel low-level mental probes. If you have a psionicist on board, you may
have mental shields set up — see <a href="#E186">E186</a>. Otherwise, you may either hyperjump
away immediately to another system (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A) or proceed as you first intended —
see <a href="#E164">E164</a>.

## <a name="E102">E102 One Ship Approaches (takes no time)</a>
An all-black warship is nearby and approaching you. You can either hyperjump
to another system (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A), try to establish contact - see <a href="#E173">E173</a>, attack it —
see <a href="#E189">E189</a>, or try to flee — see <a href="#E144">E144</a>.

## <a name="E103">E103 Debris and Stasis Unit (takes 1 hour)</a>
You see debris scattered in space and an activated stasis unit of 4 CU size.
If you take the unit, when (and if) you deactivate it roll 1d6 and refer to
the appropriate event:

| D6  | Result   |
|-----|----------|

## <a name="E104">E104 Not Detected (takes no time)</a>
You are not detected upon arrival, and may travel to the asteroid belt
(if present) or planet of your choice in the system.

## <a name="E105">E105 Merchant Ship (takes no time)</a>
Nearby is a merchant ship with 12 hit points, one turret of starship guns of
tech 2. You may ignore it, or attack it. If you attack, see <a href="#E179">E179</a>.

## <a name="E106">E106 Distress Call (takes no time)</a>
You receive a distress call from a starship in trouble. You may ignore it, and
must if your communications are inoperative — see <a href="#E109">E109</a>. You may move toward
it, spending one hour in sublight drive — see <a href="#E193">E193</a>.

## <a name="E107">E107 One-Man Ships Rushing Towards You (takes no time)</a>
You see 1d6+1 one-man Mynkurian ships rushing in your direction. You may
immediately hyperjump to another system (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A), wait a few minutes to see
what happens — see <a href="#E165">E165</a>, or attack them — see <a href="#E195">E195</a>. You cannot flee, since
they are approaching from all sides.

## <a name="E108">E108 Two Ships Approach (takes no time)</a>
You are approached by two ships with Palatek markings. You may either hyperjump
to another system (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A), wait a few minutes and allow them to board you —
see <a href="#E197">E197</a>, or attack them (<a href="#R230">R230</a>L). If you attack, and later surrender, then see
<a href="#E197">E197</a>. Palatek Frigates Ship Data: each ship has 10 hit points and one gun
turret with tech 4 starship guns. Roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                    |
|-----|-------------------------------------------|
| 1-4 | no effect                                 |
|  5  | both ships have defensive screens         |
|  6  | both ships have defensive screens and ECM |

## <a name="E109">E109 Roundabout Approach (takes 1d6 hours)</a>
You find a roundabout approach route that lets you steer clear of any other
ships, patrols, etc. but it will take 1d6 extra hours. You may use it to reach
the outermost planet (or asteroid belt, if there is one) by spending that much
extra time (normal trip is 4 hours, this will be 1d6 hours longer). If you
wish to avoid the extra time, roll again for another System Entry event.

## <a name="E110">E110 Battle in Progress (takes no time)</a>
You see a fierce space battle in progress. You may either immediately hyperjump
to another system (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A), approach the battle — see <a href="#E174">E174</a>, or try to sneak
away — see <a href="#E096">E096</a>.

## <a name="E111">E111 Mental Attack (takes no time)</a>
You are suddenly under a strong mental attack, that immobilizes your arms and
legs, so you cannot do anything! You have taken one hit of damage. You may
speak to your crew or passengers, they are unaffected. If there are none on
board, you are immobilized forever and die of starvation. If you can hail your
crew or passengers, select one of the options below: If you have a psionicist
on board to put up a mental shield see <a href="#E401">E401</a>. If you have a gunner he can man
the guns and look for a target, see <a href="#E411">E411</a>. If you have a pilot/navigator on
board, he can take the controls while you receive another 1d6 hits. Once you
are in motion you are freed and can continue normally. Anyone on board can
energize the stasis unit (<a href="#R212">R212</a>E) around the pilot compartment, see <a href="#E421">E421</a>. Note:
if you are not at the controls when this event occurs, it will apply to the
pilot/navigator at the controls instead. You may then act as the relief
pilot/navigator to take over (see above).

## <a name="E112">E112 Fired Upon by Defense System (takes no time)</a>
You are near 1d6 Nipnan gun buoys — robot controlled automatic defensive
systems. Each buoy fires upon you, and if your guns are manned you can shoot
back at one (<a href="#R230">R230</a>L). You may then either hyperjump (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A), stand and try to
disable or destroy the buoys, or try to escape the buoys with sublight drive.
If you try to escape, roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-4 | you escape and may proceed normally                                    |
| 5-6 | one hour passes and you are in range of 1d6 new buoys that again fire first on you, then you exercise the same options as before. |

Nipnan Gun Buoy: each buoy is equivalent to a tech 6 starship without drives,
and each has one tech 6 starship gun. A Buoy is destroyed by 2 hits. Any
critical hit will disable it without destroying it, which allows you to
examine it after any battle is over. If you do examine it (utility suits are
needed) see <a href="#E402">E402</a>).

## <a name="E113">E113 Microasteroid Punctures Hull (takes 1 hour)</a>
A high-velocity micro-asteroid punctures your hull and causes explosive
decompression in a compartment. One hit of damage (<a href="#R217">R217</a>) is recorded, and
anything living there that lacks a utility suit or stasis unit protection is
killed, as well as any cargo that is damaged by vacuum or lack of life
support. After this accident you spend the rest of the hour patching the hole
to repressurize, but the hit itself requires normal repair procedures (<a href="#R219">R219</a>).
Roll 2d6 to see which compartment is hit:

| 2D6   | Result                                  |
|-------|-----------------------------------------|
|  2-3  | Pilot Compartment                       |
|  4-5  | Engineering Compartment                 |
|  6-7  | Main Cargo Hold                         |
|  8-9  | Boat Hold (and Ship’s Boat, if present) |
| 10-11 | Crew Quarters                           |
|  12   | Gun Turret                              |

## <a name="E114">E114 Large Starship Orders You to Stop (takes no time)</a>
An impressively large Imperian warship, bristling with guns, orders you to
stop, take aboard an Imperian pilot to direct your planetary approach and to
receive required visas and entry permits. Your options are: To immediately
hyperjump to another system (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A); To attack or flee the battleship, space
combat (<a href="#R230">R230</a>L) will result, see <a href="#E081">E081</a> for details; To acknowledge and let the
boarding party come aboard, see <a href="#E403">E403</a>.

## <a name="E115">E115 Crewman with Weapon Drawn (takes 1 hour)</a>
If you have any hireling (including crew) hired in a Slum area, you find the
best marksman among them (if more than one) standing behind your pilot’s seat
with his best weapon. He says “slowly raise your hands, leave the controls and
come with me.”If you try to fight, you will be “surprised” in the ensuing
combat (<a href="#R230">R230</a>I), including any non-slum bodyguard with you in the compartment.
Range at start is contact for the one behind you, dispersed for all others.
Non-slum crew members will fight for you from dispersed range (after the
surprise) with any person weapons, but only if they normally fight. You can
try to energize the stasis unit in your chair, see <a href="#E404">E404</a>. You can agree to go
with him, see <a href="#E412">E412</a>.

## <a name="E116">E116 Derelict Ship (takes no time)</a>
You see a starship of unusual design, apparently without power. You may proceed
on your way — see <a href="#E104">E104</a>. Alternately, you may close with the ship and attempt
to board it. If you do, this takes one hour, and you should specify who is
going and what their equipment will be (must include a utility suit to pass
through the vacuum for boarding). When you board, roll 1d6 for result:

| D6  | Result   |
|-----|----------|
| 1-2 | see <a href="#E082">E082</a> |
|  3  | see <a href="#E408">E408</a> |
|  4  | see <a href="#E426">E426</a> |
| 5-6 | see <a href="#E430">E430</a> |

## <a name="E117">E117 Communications Failure (takes 1 hour)</a>
Your starship communications gear and all other radio equipment on board
(including ship’s boat, PS robots, etc.) has malfunctioned, apparently due to
tachyonic degradation of semiconductors. No other equipment is affected. You
can proceed as desired, and repair communications gear now or later, as
desired. Repair requires a starship engineer for the ship communications and
ship’s boat radios, a qualified repairman can fix the rest. Each item requires
one full day of RRR (<a href="#R203">R203</a>C) and one repair unit (<a href="#R211">R211</a>). The damage is very
esoteric — none of the repair units currently on board can be used.

## <a name="E118">E118 Military Scout Nearby (takes no time)</a>
A small military scout ship with Talitar insignia is nearby. They seem to be
waiting for your to do something. You can tell the ship has one standard
turret of starship guns, plus a nose cannon of unknown and unfamiliar design.
You can either (a) hyperjump to another system (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A), (b) try to escape
using your sublight drive — see <a href="#E413">E413</a>, (c) attack the scout — see <a href="#E422">E422</a>, (d)
offer them a bribe to let you pass — write down amount and see <a href="#E406">E406</a>, or (e)
sit and patiently wait for them to do something first — see <a href="#E428">E428</a>.

## <a name="E119">E119 Something on Hull (takes 1 hour)</a>
You hear a loud “clunk” reverberating through your ship. A scan of the hull
reveals an unusual metal object attached, about the size of a small skimmer.
Roll 1d6 to see where it is attached:

| D6  | Result                                          |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | on airlock                                      |
|  2  | on boat hold hanger door                        |
|  3  | on main cargo hold hatch door                   |
|  4  | on top of gun turret                            |
|  5  | in front of the pilot’s compartment             |
|  6  | in the vicinity of the hypercharge storage area |

You can either (a) energize sublight drive and proceed on your way, ignoring it
— see <a href="#E418">E418</a>, (b) hyperjump again (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A) to a new system and ignore it — see
<a href="#E423">E423</a>, (c) send a starship engineer from your crew to examine it — see <a href="#E414">E414</a>,
(d) send a nonengineer from your crew (or yourself) to examine it — see <a href="#E429">E429</a>,
(e) send a non-engineer from your crew (or yourself) to shoot it — see <a href="#E407">E407</a>.
You cannot exit the ship via a hatch or door on which the object is attached,
and thus must use another route. Opening the cargo hatch or boat hold hanger
will expose that compartment to vacuum, but you can take 1 hour to rearrange
cargo, passengers, etc., to avoid adverse effects of this.

## <a name="E120">E120 Debris in Space (takes 1 hour)</a>
You see debris in the vicinity, apparently from a destroyed ship of some sort,
and spend an hour scanning it carefully. However, you find nothing of interest
or value, and may proceed normally.

## <a name="E121">E121 Starship Nearby Ignores You (takes 1 hour)</a>
Your scanners pick up a larger starship nearby that seems motionless but
currently with power. It is an unconventional design, with a non-metallic hull
that emits infrared radiation. It is apparently ignoring you. You can either
go on your way and end this event; or you can take one more hour to approach
within boarding range and try to board. Note who is in the boarding party,
equipment carried (utility suits are required), then roll 1d6 and go to the
appropriate event:

| D6  | Result   |
|-----|----------|
| 1-2 | see <a href="#E408">E408</a> |
|  3  | see <a href="#E416">E416</a> |

|  6  | see <a href="#E430">E430</a> |

## <a name="E122">E122 Prospective Crewman (takes 1 hour)</a>
You meet an impoverished person who is anxious to leave the system. He will
join your crew free if you take him permanently off planet. He will be
“wanted” in this system if you ever return here. Roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |

|  1  | Pilot/Navigator (<a href="#R221">R221</a>A) with <a href="#E7">E7</a>, M2, H1                                |
|  2  | Starship Engineer (<a href="#R221">R221</a>B) with <a href="#E4">E4</a>, M0, H2 and a qualified skimmer driver |
|  3  | Starship Gunner (<a href="#R221">R221</a>C) with <a href="#E6">E6</a>, M3, H3                                |
|  4  | Ship’s Steward and skimmer driver (<a href="#R221">R221</a>E) with <a href="#E8">E8</a>, M0, H1 who is an excellent cook and very knowledgeable about wine and spirits |
|  5  | Robot Repairman who can repair any type of robot (<a href="#R219">R219</a>) of tech level 4 or less, and who also will act as bodyguard (<a href="#R221">R221</a>D) although he cannot use ranged weapons, being <a href="#E6">E6</a>, M0, H4 |
|  6  | retired merchant supply officer who can drive a skimmer (<a href="#R221">R221</a>E) and has experience in jury-rigged equipment, making deals and trades, etc. His presence in your party will add one (+1) to your Cunning, and his presence with equipment during a day reduces its tech level by one (-1) for break-down purposes only (<a href="#R218">R218</a>). |

## <a name="E123">E123 Guns to Talitar (takes rest of day)</a>
Two men ask you to take them and a cargo of guns to the underground movement on
Talitar. If you deliver the men and 50 CU of cargo (heavy hand weapons - tech
4, in 25 2-CU cases) to any area on Talitar undetected they will pay you 600 S
now and another 6,000 S at the time of safe delivery. Each man is <a href="#E8">E8</a>, M5, H3
and has his own utility suit and heavy hand weapons of Tech 4. If you take
this offer, the men are “wanted” and the weapons are considered contraband on
Talitar, Palatek, Byzantium, and Imperia. Anywhere else the guns are
contraband only if so indicated by events. The men will fight alongside you
whenever you request in the above systems, or whenever they or the cargo are
threatened. However, they will not voluntarily leave the ship until you arrive
at Talitar, If they are safely delivered but detected on the way, they only
pay you 3,000 S instead of the original 6,000 S; for each man killed or crate
of cargo lost they will deduct 500 S.

## <a name="E124">E124 Corrosive Fumes (takes 1 hour)</a>
Vents from old mine wastes are nearby — you have entered an area of corrosive
fumes and bad air. Make an immediate breakdown roll (<a href="#R218">R218</a>) for each metallic
item with you, including vehicle, robots, and weaponry. Items purchased on
Cubro and utility suits are immune, as well as packed cargo. Each person in
the area automatically suffers one hit instantly. In addition, any person
without access to life support will receive one hit per hour (<a href="#R231">R231</a>) for the
rest of this day. At the end of the day the fumes disperse, if you haven’t yet
departed from the area.

## <a name="E125">E125 Alien Intruder on Starship (takes 1 hour)</a>
You become aware of a glowing, tentacled alien being in the crew’s quarters of
your starship. It is apparently either eating your mattresses or making a nest
— pieces of mattress are flying everywhere! You may either (a) enter the crew
quarters and attack it - see <a href="#E162">E162</a>, or (b) try to establish friendly contact by
making gestures that it is welcome to the mattresses see <a href="#E171">E171</a>. In either case,
designate exactly who enters, and with what. If you try to be friendly, just
one individual will attempt this.

## <a name="E126">E126 Debugging Team (takes rest of day)</a>
A professional debugging team will remove all bugs and surveillance devices
from your vehicles and equipment for a base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 300 S.

## <a name="E127">E127 Foreign Program Seizes Computer (takes no time)</a>
A program of unknown origin has gained access to your starship’s computer,
perhaps through a teleprocessing port or attached memory device. If you are on
board and succeed with a Cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>) you act instantly to shut down
the computer. This will prevent hyperjump and use of starship guns until a
base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 120 S is paid at any spaceport, space station or
scientific area is paid to replace the computer software.

If you are not on board when the program takes control, your starship is lost
to you, with all on board.

If you are on board, but fail your Cunning roll, the starship immediately
hyperjumps to Imperia, or as close as possible with the hypercharges there on
board. At system entry after this jump, the program causes the starship guns
to immediately open fire (<a href="#R230">R230</a>L) at any ship(s) present, and to continue
firing until all ships present or your ship is destroyed. At this point the
program erases and the computer becomes useless until new software is
purchased (see above).

## <a name="E128">E128 Social Error (takes 1d6 hours)</a>
You have unwittingly offended the Uruskopians, by violating some aspect of
their social code. An enraged mob suddenly flocks about you (or your vehicle),
preventing any further progress. If you and your party abandon everything you
have, including robots, vehicles, etc., but excluding utility suits and
sidearms (which you can keep), you escape without harm. If you do not abandon
items and flee, as indicated above, each member of your party is in contact
and combat by 1d6 people of the mob. Each person in the mob is <a href="#E5">E5</a>, M0, H2 and
unarmed. You must fight your way out, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>. When at least half the mob
persons originally in contact are killed or disabled, the remainder flee, the
battle ends. The battle will not end until this occurs, or you and your party
are dead — normal escape is impossible.

## <a name="E129">E129 Hit by Speeder (takes 1 hour)</a>
If you are in a vehicle, you have a collision with another vehicle of the same
type (skimmer takes 1 hit damage, ship’s boat or starship takes 1d6 hits of
damage, see <a href="#R217">R217</a>). If you and your party are on foot, a careening skimmer runs
into you, each person in the party must roll 1d6. A 5 or 6 result means that
person is hit, and suffers 2d6 hits of damage. If you are “hit” you can dodge
with a successful Cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>) and avoid damage.

## <a name="E130">E130 Arrested as Spy (takes 1 hour)</a>
You are arrested as a spy. You may go willingly — see <a href="#E023">E023</a>, may try to bribe
them with base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 250 S - see <a href="#R321">R321</a>, or try to escape — see <a href="#R327">R327</a>.

## <a name="E131">E131 Palace Contact (takes rest of day)</a>
You make contact with a servant of the palace, and can pay for information.
Roll 1d6 to determine exact sum you need to pay:

| D6  | Result    |
|-----|-----------|
|  1  | 25 S      |
|  2  | 50 S      |

|  4  | 400 S     |
|  5  | 1,000 S   |
|  6  | 3,000 S   |

If you pay this amount, then roll 1d6 and add it to the first (payment level)
roll and consult results below:

| 2D6 | Result                                                                 |

| 10  | you may steal a collection of rare books from the palace, 18 CU in size, and worth 6,500 S base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) at any other palace |
| 11  | you may steal the pet starfleeter of the King — a starfleeter is an alien lifeform with a psionic power of 20 that immediately attacks all persons in your party, evenly distributing its strength to each (see <a href="#E022">E022</a>), and each following day it makes another such attack, until it is exposed to vacuum which causes suspended animation for one week after which roll 1d6: 1-5 it revives 6 it dies — a starfleeter is worth 5,000 S base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) anywhere in the New Karma system |
| 12  | you may attempt to steal the crown jewels tonight; determine the makeup of your party, then consult <a href="#E059">E059</a>; if you survive that, you take the jewels; they can be sold to any gem dealer for a base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 60,000 S and occupy 2 CU of space; any customs agent or inspector will recognize them instantly if found, and at that point (and only then) you will become “wanted” in this system. |

|  6  | she falls in love with you, wants to leave for a life of adventure, although she is <a href="#E3">E3</a>, M0, H1 and penniless! her family will pay you 50,000 S for her safe return to the palace within five weeks (50 days) otherwise you become “wanted” (<a href="#R228">R228</a>) in the system |


## <a name="E132">E132 Wait or Flee Wardrone (takes 1 hour/round)</a>
Without hesitation the Nipnan drone speeds towards your ship, trying to strike
it. Roll as if being attacked by tech 6 starship guns (<a href="#R230">R230</a>L), If the drone
hits, it detonates and causes 1d6+1 hits of damage. If the drone misses, you
can reply that round by either making a hyperjump (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A) or opening fire —
see <a href="#E079">E079</a>, or trying to escape (<a href="#R230">R230</a>L). If you try to escape, in addition to
firing if you wish (and have both pilot and gunner), if you fail to escape for
two hours in a row, during the third hour the drone’s engine runs down,
preventing it from making a further attack. It will detonate (no damage to
you) on a 1d6 roll of 1-4, but on a roll of 5-6 you can recover it and sell it
on Mynkuria at any military area for exactly 3,000 S. You cannot repair or use
the drone yourself.

## <a name="E133">E133 Mynkurian Death Squad (takes 1 hour)</a>
You are “recognized” as a Nipnan agent by a Mynkurian death squad. They
instantly launch a suicide attack against you (<a href="#R327">R327</a>). They will fight to the
death, regardless of odds or tactical situation. Mynkurian Death Squad Troops:
two “miners”, each <a href="#E3">E3</a>, M0, H4 rigged with high explosives — if they contact
any vehicle or robot (or failing that, any person) they blow themselves up
(see <a href="#<a href="#R230">R230</a>">R230</a>E and R230K for explosive hits); two “gold slayers” who are <a href="#E5">E5</a>, M0,
H6 who attempt to contact any officer or leader (including yourself) and hit
hand-to-hand with poison-tipped spikes that cause one wound and immediate
disablement, furthermore, unless immediately treated with first aid (<a href="#R231">R231</a>)
after each later round of combat roll 1d6

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-4 | the victim suffers another hit from poison                             |
| 5-6 | the poison has no more potency, there is no further effect; finally, the squad has two “spitters” each <a href="#E4">E4</a>, M4, H2 armed with heavy hand weapons (see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level) who fire at anyone holding a weapon (if none, any opponent). |

## <a name="E134">E134 Talitarian Troopers (takes 1 hour)</a>
You have met a patrol of troopers. If you wish to fight at once, refer to <a href="#R327">R327</a>
and subtract one from the dice roll there. Instead, you can listen to their
demand. They order you to put down all your weapons, leave your vehicle (if
you have one) and show your papers. If you refuse this, refer to <a href="#R327">R327</a> and
subtract two from your dice roll there. If you obey, any without proper papers
are arrested (<a href="#E023">E023</a>). Alternately, although they seem a nasty bunch, you can
try to bribe them for 50 S. If you do, roll 1d6

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-3 | they accept the bribe                                                  |
| 4-6 | they refuse and a battle ensues, refer to <a href="#R327">R327</a> and subtract two from the dice roll there. |

Talitarian Patrol: composed of eight (8) men, each is <a href="#E6">E6</a>, M4, H4 armed with
heavy hand weapons (see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level).

## <a name="E135">E135 Hostile Life Force (takes no time)</a>
You encounter a hostile life force — a greenish glowing cylinder of energy.
Your vehicles and robots (if any) immediate break down (<a href="#R219">R219</a>). The life force
has Endurance 5, and appears to be trying to contact and engulf individuals,
to destroy them. You may fire weapons at it — see <a href="#E163">E163</a>, attack it hand-to-hand
— see <a href="#E170">E170</a>, abandon your vehicle and flee — see <a href="#E176">E176</a>, feed it life support
units (decide how many now) — see <a href="#E194">E194</a>, or stand and let it engulf you — see
<a href="#E187">E187</a>.

## <a name="E136">E136 Imperial Guards (takes no time)</a>
You meet a troop of 1d6+4 Imperial Guardsmen, with gleaming weapons and lavish
uniforms. Each is <a href="#E5">E5</a>, M2, H2. You may wait to see what they do — see <a href="#R322">R322</a>, or
attack them instantly — see <a href="#E166">E166</a>.

## <a name="E137">E137 Sabotage/Theft (takes 1 hour)</a>
When you return to the vehicle you used last, you find it has been broken into,
with only minor damage (no actual hits). However, every Repair Unit, Fuel
Unit, and Life Support Unit is missing. There is no indication as to who did
this.

## <a name="E138">E138 Arrested as Spy (takes no time)</a>
You are suddenly surrounded by two Mynkurian Death Squads (a total of twelve
fanatical-looking men), who announce your arrest on suspicion of being a
Nipnan spy. You may go with them — see <a href="#E183">E183</a>, or fight them — see <a href="#E133">E133</a> but
double the number of opponents since there are two squads, referring to <a href="#R327">R327</a>
for the actual combat situation.

## <a name="E139">E139 You are Bugged (takes 1 hour)</a>
Your vehicle(s) and equipment have bugs and surveillance devices on them.
Hereafter, you will always be detected on entry to a new area on this planet
(<a href="#R225">R225</a>). You cannot remove the bugs yourself, professionals are needed; The
bugs will not function on any other planet, but will resume functioning if you
return to this planet.

## <a name="E140">E140 Attack by “Zombies” (takes 1 hour)</a>
Your party is rushed by persons that seem stumbling and awkward, with a
lifeless appearance in their eyes. There are 1d6 times ten (x10) of them, each
<a href="#E10">E10</a>, M0, H1. If you are in a ship’s boat or starship they cannot hurt you, but
inflict one hit of damage to your vehicle. If you are in any other vehicle,
they overturn and wreck it on the first rush, and begin smashing it around you.
Therefore, in all other cases, the first round of combat begins (<a href="#R230">R230</a>) in the
normal fashion.

## <a name="E141">E141 Talitarian Troopers (see reference)</a>
You meet a trooper patrol. Their sergeant isn’t too bright, if you succeed with
a Cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>) you outsmart him. Whether you do or not, refer to <a href="#E134">E134</a>.
If you outsmarted him, add two (+2) to all dice rolls made in that paragraph,
if you don’t, make dice rolls normally.

## <a name="E142">E142 Riot in the Streets (time varies)</a>
You find yourself in the midst of a street riot. There are too many people to
fight. Instead, each hour, starting with this, try a Cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>), if
you succeed you escape, if not, each person in your party, each robot, and
each vehicle takes one hit of damage (<a href="#R217">R217</a>).

## <a name="E143">E143 Religious Cult (takes no time)</a>
A group of 1d6+6 men in lavender robes approach you, chanting strangely, but
apparently unarmed. Their leader asks you to make a contribution in 2d6 times
ten (x10) S -that is, 20 S to 120 S for their church.

If you make the contribution, roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-4 | they continue onward                                                   |
|  5  | they follow your party for the next five days preaching and trying to convince you to give them all your wealth and forget worldly affairs by joining their church |
|  6  | they stop to talk and pass on an interesting rumor, see r328.          |

If you don’t make the contribution, roll 1d6:

| 2D6 | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | they continue onward                                                   |
|  3  | they loudly curse you and your offspring but continue on               |
|  4  | they begin pelting you with dog droppings from the street, but run off when you become hostile |
| 5-6 | they become very hostile, see <a href="#E184">E184</a>                                     |

## <a name="E144">E144 Try to Flee (takes 1 hour/round)</a>
The black ship immediately opens fire (<a href="#R230">R230</a>L) with its tech 1 starship guns,
but will not pursue. It will continue to fire until you escape, are destroyed,
or destroy it.

## <a name="E145">E145 Bio-Plastics (takes 1 hour)</a>
You are offered the opportunity to have a bio-plastic alloy installed in your
starship for 20,000 S or ship’s boat for 4,000 S, and/ or to buy a bio-plastic
utility suit for 500 S. Installation on ship or boat requires that tomorrow be
spent in RRR doing that only. All bio-plastic have self repair ability. The
ship or boat repairs itself (<a href="#R219">R219</a>) one hit per day (even without RRR), while
the utility suit will seal any type of wound, not just single hits. If you buy
the bio-plastic, make a note to roll 1d6 ten days from now, and on a “6”
consult <a href="#E167">E167</a>.

## <a name="E146">E146 Anti-Robot Cult (time varies)</a>
You encounter a cult dedicated to the destruction of robots. If your party has
no robots, they pass peacefully. If you have robots, they will immediately
attack them, and anyone in the way (<a href="#R230">R230</a>), fighting to the death to destroy
the robots. There is one leader of the cultists, <a href="#E7">E7</a>, M3, H4 with a magnetic
scrambler of tech 5 that does no harm to humans, but destroys a robot beyond
repair if it hits one. There are ten additional cultists, each <a href="#E4">E4</a>, M0H4 who
will wreck a robot with their hammers if they make any successful hit in
hand-to-hand combat. The battle and aftermath will consume one hour of time.

## <a name="E147">E147 Attack by Beggars (takes 1 hour)</a>
Your party is engulfed in a crowd of beggars, irate because you are obviously
better off than they! Roll 2d6 and multiply by five (x5) for how much money,
in Secs (S), you must throw at them to drive them away. If you don’t pay them,
1d6 times four (x4) will attack you, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>. Each beggar is <a href="#E2">E2</a>, M1, H2 with
the ranged weapons being stones and other hard objects, tech level 1. Their
objective is to steal, and a successful hit in hand-to-hand combat means they
will carry off one item from that person and disappear, rather than actually
inflict any injury. If there is nothing to carry, the beggar will inflict the
hit instead (due to rage).

## <a name="E148">E148 Mindcrawler on Ship (takes 1 hour if you are present)</a>
Wherever you are, your starship has been infiltrated by a mindcrawler. It
chooses one person on board at random, and attempts to take over the person’s
brain. It is an <a href="#E20">E20</a>, M0, H0 creature with limitless psionic power that it uses
to make a 2-point attack each round (see <a href="#E022">E022</a> for procedure). You can attack
it using normal combat (<a href="#R230">R230</a>) to kill it.

Each time the mindcrawler makes a successful psionic attack, roll 1d6: if the
result exceeds the current endurance of the target, that person is taken over
and becomes a mindcrawler also. If not, normal damage from the attack is done
instead.

If a person becomes a mindcrawler, it too begins to attack one of the remaining
persons on board. If you become a mindcrawler, you die and lose. When all
mindcrawlers are dead, or the entire ship is taken over, the encounter ends
and the mindcrawlers disappear (looking for prey elsewhere).

## <a name="E149">E149 Odd Machine (takes 1 hour)</a>
You have found a 2 CU device of unknown function, carefully hidden away. You
can examine it and attempt to use it, if you do, spend another hour and roll
2d6 for the result:

| 2D6 | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  2  | it explodes and inflicts 1d6 hits on each per person, and one hit on each vehicle and robot present (<a href="#R217">R217</a>) |
|  3  | emits a high tone that shatters the teeth of all present, inflicting one hit — it can be later used as a |
|  4  | automatic pudding dispenser that will produce two LSUs (<a href="#R213">R213</a>) per day, but breaks down permanently after dispensing ten units |
|  5  | document shredder that can be sold for 10 S at any military area       |
|  6  | small animal repeller that turns away any animal of Endurance 3 or less, costs 1S per day to operate, worth 35 S if sold in a rural area |
|  7  | emits loud burbling sound but has no other effect unless you tried it on Uruskop, then refer to <a href="#E128">E128</a> |
|  8  | causes an automatic breakdown (<a href="#R218">R218</a>) on your nearest vehicle, then melts |
|  9  | a tech 5 ECM unit for your starship, that requires a full day of RRR, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>L for effect |
| 10  | tech 4 starship defensive screen unit, takes a full day of RRR to install, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>L for effect |
| 11  | trap-that goes off, see <a href="#E059">E059</a>, if you survive roll again for what the trap protected |
| 12  | personal power armor of tech 6 in a suitcase; armor when powered-up is 1 CU and similar to utility suit, except it has integral life support that lasts for 2 days before it needs a 1 S recharge at a spaceport or space station, or a free recharge at your starship; in combat any one ranged weapon hit or two hand-to-hand hits each round can be ignored, and the tech level of all ranged weapons firing on it are reduced by one; if the armor breaks down, the wearer must get out of it to move (unless carried by others), and the powerless armor now is equivalent to 2 CU in weight and bulk. |

## <a name="E150">E150 Space Mist (takes no time)</a>
Your party is engulfed in a cloud of “space mist.” This causes a mild itching
sensation, but no damage. Unfortunately, vehicles and utility suits provide no
protection, except that starships with defensive screens are safe. Each
hireling in your retinue (<a href="#R220">R220</a>) requires a 1d6 roll, and on 1 or 2 will
immediately quit your service, taking all their equipment with them. If in
orbit, they will find a shuttle service of some sort anyway. You cannot
prevent them from leaving except by combat (<a href="#R230">R230</a>), if they are disabled they
will leave anyway (when they recover), but leave any equipment behind.


## <a name="E151">E151 Respiratory Disease (takes no time)</a>
You have spent too much time on Palatek, and contracted a respiratory disease.
It causes the permanent loss of one of your Endurance points. For each
additional day you spend on Palatek you suffer one extra hit, but no further
permanent loss, even if you leave and later return. The disease is incurable,
its effects cannot be prevented or the permanent loss restored.

## <a name="E152">E152 Time Machine (takes 1 hour)</a>
You are approached by an elderly gentleman who claims to have invented a time
machine, and needs a volunteer to test it. You may ignore him and end this
encounter, or go with him to test it. If you go with him, you spend the rest
of the day there. He puts you in a shiny metal globe packed with equipment,
wishes you luck, and starts the machine, roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | the device fails, you emerge coughing from the acrid smoke and leave, cursing to yourself |
| 3-5 | the device works, but is out of control, you are plunged hopelessly far into the past or future, unable to return, and eventually die — you lose the game |
|  6  | the machine works and you can control it; you are able to jump forward and back at will, giving you the ability to amass limitless wealth and avoid any problems with the authorities, you instantly win the game. |

## <a name="E153">E153 High Technology Item (takes 1 hour)</a>
You have the opportunity to buy one high-technology item. Roll 2d6 to determine
which item is available. All items are tech 6, with the base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A)
given in brackets [ ].

| 2D6 | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  2  | upgraded sublight drive for your starship. Escape is automatic from any ship of tech 5 or less, normal escape ability against tech 6 ships. Upgrading takes a full day of RRR to install at a spaceport or station [10,000 s] |
|  3  | ECCM electronic counter-countermeasures unit of 3 CU size that negates the effect of any ECM unit [800 S] |
|  4  | Regrowth Tank that allows rapid healing for one person (<a href="#R231">R231</a>), with 1d6 hits healed per day if the person stays in the tank the entire day. The tank requires installation in the starship and takes 4 CU. If it breaks down the day it is in use, the person suffers 1d6 extra hits instead of healing that many [2,000 S] |
|  5  | Shadow Suit that can be worn by anyone not in a utility suit. It will reduce the Detection Factor (<a href="#R238">R238</a>) by one (-1) of the wearer if entering a land area on foot and alone (or with other shadow suit wearers only). Anyone shooting at a wearer has accuracy (<a href="#R230">R230</a>D) reduced by two. Wearing a shadow suit costs 1 S per day for consumable items (IR filters, etc.) [200 S] |
|  6  | Portable Life Support Unit that when collapsed is 4 CU in size with a 1 CU power plant. When the 4-CU unit is unfolded (takes 1 hour) it expands to hold 50 CU and provides life support (<a href="#R213">R213</a>) for a month. The 1 CU power plant only runs for that month, after which a week of recharging at a starship power plant is needed [40 S per collapsible unit, 300 S per plant] |
|  7  | Starship Defensive Screens composed of two separate 2 CU devices, one installed in the engine compartment, and one in some other compartment of the starship, and controlled from the pilot’s compartment. Effects of screens are described in <a href="#R230">R230</a>L [500 S] |
|  8  | ECM electronic countermeasures unit 1 CU in size. It provides added protection for a starship (see <a href="#R230">R230</a>L) if installed in the engine compartment [500 S] |
|  9  | Vacuum Skimmer that performs like an ordinary skimmer, but able to function in bad air or no air, as well as good air. However, it does not provide life support unless a special version with this feature is purchased. [100 S for standard version, 200 S for version with integral life support] |
| 10  | High Power Sidearm that is like a normal sidearm in size and use, (<a href="#R215">R215</a>D) except it fires like a heavy hand weapon with explosive charges (<a href="#R230">R230</a>E) [50 S] |
| 11  | Power Pack fusion plant that never requires recharging or any additional cost. The fusion power pack replaces a normal fuel unit; a pack for a skimmer is 1 CU in size [80 S], a pack for a ship’s boat is 10 CU in size and provides power equivalent to 10 fuel units per hour [2,000 S] |
| 12  | Personal Force Field that occupies 1 CU turned off, 2 CU activated, and surrounds the wearer when activated. When activated it prevents anyone from getting into contact (<a href="#R230">R230</a>B) with the wearer, and protects the wearer from explosive weapon effects, but not from normal hit effects. If the personal force field is activated when a hyperjump occurs, or inside a stasis field, it immediately explodes and kills the wearer. The force field when activated can surround a person in a utility suit [800 S] |

## <a name="E154">E154 Volcanic Vents (takes no time)</a>
You have entered an area with active volcanic vents. Roll immediately for
break-down (<a href="#R218">R218</a>) of the equipment listed below, and each additional hour you
remain roll again. A roll of “5” or “6” automatically results in break-down,
regardless of equipment tech level (in addition to normal results). Equipment
involved is: utility suits, skimmers, commercial transport, and ship’s boat.

In addition, each person without life support (after equipment breakdown is
determined) must roll 1d6 per hour spent here, a “5” or “6” means one hit is
suffered (<a href="#R231">R231</a>).

## <a name="E155">E155 Secret Police (takes 1 hour)</a>
The always efficient Byzantine secret police stop you for questioning. If you
have committed any crime on Byzantium since you have been here, including
bringing in contraband materials, buying or selling any stolen or illegal
goods, entered any Palace or Military area (illegal to the unauthorized, such
as you), or engaged in any bribery or theft, the secret police have discovered
this already and arrest you. If you haven’t, they let you proceed.

If arrested, you can go peacefully, see <a href="#E023">E023</a>. Alternately, you can resist
arrest by fighting, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>. There are twelve officers present, each <a href="#E6">E6</a>, M3,
H5, half with heavy hand weapons, half with sidearms (see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech).

## <a name="E156">E156 Clone Bank (takes 1 hour)</a>
You are offered the services of a clone bank. If you accept, the procedure will
take the rest of the day. In a clone bank, a mental scan recording of your
mind and body are made for a base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 1,000 S, payed in advance.
Unless a message is received within 40 days, the bank will assume you have
died, and will activate the clone, which has all of your memories, abilities,
etc. up to this date (including location of any caches, <a href="#R229">R229</a>C). Normally you
send a “do not activate” message every month to prevent this, paying 100 S if
in another star system for a special message-jump relay. You can also visit
the bank in this area in the future, and for 50 S update the memories of your
clone.

The advantage of a clone is that you are protected from true death, in that
should you die (and thus fail to send the “hold” message) the clone is
activated. The clone thinks, acts, looks, and for all practical purposes IS
you, although without your possessions or papers. If the original “you” is
killed, you can immediately jump forward in time to the end of the next 40-day
period and continue play in the persona of the clone, effectively “erasing”
all knowledge, information, and events that occurred after the date of the
last memory update.

Setting up special accounts and identities for your clone is often a good idea.
If for some reason your clone is activated while you still live (due to
failing to send the “hold” message), you can select whichever persona you
prefer at that point, and forget the other. However, after each day you must
roll a 2d6, and if “12” results, you meet your double and go into permanent
catatonic shock, causing you to lose the game instantly (you and the clone
become vegetables).


## <a name="E157">E157 Transport Fighters to Nipna (takes rest of day)</a>
You are contacted by a Mynkurian Intelligence colonel, who proposes that you
smuggle his men onto Nipna (any area). Secrecy is important, so you will not
be paid unless you leave his men there and return here, directly, at which
time you will receive 300 S for each man transported successfully. You can
carry as many as you wish, up to the maximum capacity of your ship. Each man
takes 2 CU of space with his equipment, and cannot survive in vacuum (does not
have utility suit). If you encounter any difficulty on Nipna, including any
search, examination or boarding of your ship, the men on board will instantly
flee, and you will not be paid. Naturally, the Nipnan penalty for such
smuggling is death (which, if you are imprisoned by the Nipnans, will occur
1d6 days after you land in jail).

## <a name="E158">E158 Gravity Surge (takes no time)</a>
Scientific testing of an anti gravity device on this planet has had a
calamitous result! The gravity of the entire planet has been increased by half
(round fractions down, so a gravity 7 planet would become a gravity 10.5,
rounded down to 10). This has caused terrible destruction across the planet.
All city, gambling, industrial, palace, prison, scientific, slum and spaceport
areas are now ruins, all mining areas are now craters. All space stations and
anything else in orbit, including all caches, have plunged to the planet and
are destroyed. All travel times between land areas are doubled, for any mode
of travel.

Make an immediate breakdown roll (<a href="#R218">R218</a>) for each item of equipment you have on
the planet, whether you are using it or not. If it breaks down, it may never
be used on this planet again, even if repaired. If it doesn’t break down, it
may be used, and any future breakdowns are treated normally. Note that the
increased gravity may prevent takeoff by a ship’s boat.

## <a name="E159">E159 Rich Man & Thugs (takes 1 hour)</a>
You see a party comprised of an obviously rich individual, guarded by 1d6+6
thugs (each <a href="#E8">E8</a>, M4, H6 armed with a sidearm, see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level). You can
ignore him, or you can attack him. If you attack, see <a href="#R302">R302</a>. You must defeat
them in five combat rounds, since after that the rich man will escape. If you
disable or kill the rich man, you find he has a base value wealth of 1d6 times
100 (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A). If you attacked the rich man, you automatically become “wanted”
here.

## <a name="E160">E160 Royal Guards (takes 1 hour)</a>
Five men dressed in uniforms of the palace guard appear. Each is <a href="#E8">E8</a>, M3, H6 and
armed with ceremonial halberds (inflict double damage if they hit in
hand-to-hand combat) and sidearms (see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level). They move to
arrest you— if they do, see <a href="#E023">E023</a>. You can chose to resist, see <a href="#R327">R327</a>, but if
you do, they have no scruples about killing you in combat. After five rounds
of combat, another four royal guardsmen will appear.

## <a name="E161">E161 Attack the Ship’s Boat (takes 1 hour)</a>
Your gunner fires on the boat — determine the effects of the shot (<a href="#R230">R230</a>L). If
you score a critical hit of any type, the boat explodes. Otherwise, three
psionicists on the boat respond with a psionic attack (<a href="#E022">E022</a>) against your
gunner. Each psionicist has <a href="#E10">E10</a> and psionic power 12, and will make a size 4
attack each round until they or the gunner are dead. You may end the encounter
by leaving the area with sublight drive or hyperdrive, they cannot pursue.

## <a name="E162">E162 Attack the Alien (takes 1 hour)</a>
When your party enters the crew’s quarters to make the attack, any weapons of
tech 4 or higher immediately detonate, inflicting 2 hits on the person
carrying it. The alien then extends its tentacles and grasps one attacker
(selected at random) and draws the person into its glowing mass.

If you have anyone with a weapon of tech level 3 or less, you now kill the
alien, but your crewman is gone. If you do not have such a weapon, you are
helpless against it and must withdraw. When you withdraw, roll 1d6, on a 5 or
6 one more person at random is seized and destroyed before you can withdraw.

After you withdraw, scanners inform you that the alien has left the ship.

## <a name="E163">E163 Fire Weapons at Life Force (takes no time)</a>
Count the number of weapons fired at the life force, and add this number to its
Endurance. Weapon firing only seems to make it stronger. Return to <a href="#E135">E135</a> and
select another option.

## <a name="E164">E164 Ignore Mental Probes and Proceed (takes no time)</a>
If you have entered this system directly from Nipna or Mynkuria, or if you
cargo includes any weapons, ammunition, or military equipment, you are now
“wanted” (<a href="#R228">R228</a>) in the New Karma system. Otherwise, there is no effect from
this encounter.

## <a name="E165">E165 Wait for One-Man Ships (takes 1 hour)</a>
Each of the small ships collides with your starship and explodes. Each inflicts
two hits of damage. ECM does not help you, but if defensive screens exist and
are energized, roll 1d6 for each attacker:

| D6  | Result                                                           |

|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-3 | combat ensues, see <a href="#R327">R327</a> and add one (+1) to your dice roll there                                               |
| 4-6 | and they cry out in terror and run away, dropping their weapons. These may be sold for base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 5 S at any city or colony on. Palatek, Byzantium, or Talitar. The weapons are virtually useless in combat and occupy 1 CU each. |

## <a name="E167">E167 Alloy Comes to Life (takes 1 hour)</a>
The item you purchased of bio-plastic alloy has actually come to life! It
begins digesting whatever is inside. If you or any others have been within a
bio-plastic vehicle during the past day, suffer 1d6 hits of acid damage before
you escape. If you wore a bioplastic utility suit in the past day you are
completely digested and dead. Any vehicle or suit that comes to life will
creep off by itself and is completely lost and unusable. Any goods inside a
vehicle are lost.

## <a name="E168">E168 Nothing of Interest (takes 1 hour)</a>
Terrain is dull and boring, you find nothing of interest.

## <a name="E169">E169 Wait for Boat (takes 1 hour)</a>
You allow the boat to dock with your starship. Three persons come on board,
leaving the pilot/navigator they hired on the boat, which then disengages and
departs. The three who boarded are psionicists, each <a href="#E10">E10</a>, M1, H2 with psionic
power (<a href="#E022">E022</a>) of 12. Roll 1d6 to see what they want (below). If you refuse,
each immediately launches an attack against you (or your psionicist if a
mental shield is raised), continuing until you or they are dead, or you agree
to cooperate. If this combat occurs, see <a href="#R327">R327</a>.

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | immediate passage to any other star system; they will pay 600 S each for passage. |
|  2  | deliver them to any city or colony in this system for 100 S. each      |
|  3  | they want to join your crew, with a salary of 10 S per day, plus a bonus of 20 S each combat they fight; if you refuse this, they act like an unpaid crew member |
|  4  | passage to Regari, where they must arrive within two weeks; they will pay 300 S each for this, and  won’t leave the starship until arrival. They will fight only to defend themselves personally, and will not help you otherwise |
|  5  | they want to purchase hallucinogenic drugs or liquor from you, at a cost of 100 S per CU (up to a maximum of 9 CUs — three per person). If they obtain these, they will settle down in the crew’s quarters and consume them at the rate of 1 CU per day until the supply is used up. After they have consumed them, or immediately if you have no drugs or liquor, they will ask to be landed on some planet with good air, and will pay you 50 S for each at the time of landing |
|  6  | they request that you join, the Church of the Silver Mandala, and devote your efforts and starship to spreading their teachings. They will pay for all hypercharges you use, in any system, provided they can ride with you. At least one will personally accompany you at all times. Every other day on a planet must be spent in RRR helping them preach and proselytize (you cannot do anything else that day, but your crew can). They will not interfere in your other activities, but refuse to engage in any combat except personal defense if contacted hand-to-hand. |

## <a name="E170">E170 Attack Life Force Hand-to-Hand (takes 1 hour)</a>
Each person attacking hand-to-hand is engulfed and consumed by the life force.
Each one consumed adds one point to its Endurance. If you were attacking
hand-to-hand, you can avoid engulfment and death with a successful Cunning
roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>). Return to <a href="#E135">E135</a> and choose another option.

## <a name="E171">E171 Attempt Friendly Contact (takes 1 hour)</a>
The alien decides to be friendly too, and establishes a permanent mind-meld
with the person who made contact. This causes an immediate and permanent
reduction in Endurance of 1d6-1 (to a minimum of one). The alien will always
remain near his friend, occupying 2 CU.

The alien will happily suffer concealment in a 2 CU box, provided he is freed
at the end of each day. If not concealed, he will frighten anyone the person
encounters, causing them to attack the alien (see <a href="#E162">E162</a> for results, the weapon
destruction applies to everyone, including your party, except the mind-melded
person).

The alien provides these advantages to his friend: (a) anyone firing on the
friend with ranged weapons has three added (+3) to the “to hit” dice roll, and
(b) the friend automatically has life support provided (no need for utility
suit or LSUs). The alien always remains with the friend, if the friend leaves
your party, so will the alien.

## <a name="E172">E172 Mine Guards (takes 1 hour)</a>
You attract the attention of mine guards, who think you intend to jump a claim,
or steal valuable minerals. See <a href="#R324">R324</a>. There are eight (8) guards, each is <a href="#E5">E5</a>,
M3, H4 and armed with a heavy hand weapons (see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level).

## <a name="E173">E173 Try for Contact (takes 1 hour)</a>
You make contact, and discover this is a ship of the Byzantine secret police.
If you had any encounter with them before, or succeed with a Cunning roll
(<a href="#R202">R202</a>), they wish to deal with you. Otherwise, of if you are “wanted” by
Byzantium, they demand to board you for a search.

Dealing with the Byzantine Secret Police Ship - roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | they wish you to smuggle a 4 CU stasis unit to the nearest planet for them, you will be paid 300 S after you land it on the planet; you can de-energize it yourself (<a href="#R212">R212</a>E), but if you do see <a href="#E425">E425</a> when it is opened, and you become “wanted” on Byzantium |
| 3-4 | conceal one of their men on your ship and take him to the nearest planet, you will be paid 550 S when he arrives undetected, and nothing otherwise (the man will dexterously disappear if found earlier) |
| 5-6 | conceal one of their men and take him to the palace on Imperia, you will be paid 3,000 S when you return to Byzantium after a successful delivery, again their man must be undetected — if detected he disappears and you will not be paid anything. |

Boarding for Search by Byzantine Secret Police: If you resist boarding, see
<a href="#E189">E189</a>. If you allow boarding, two men come on board, each <a href="#E6">E6</a>, M2, H3 with
tech-2 sidearms who search (<a href="#R229">R229</a>D) the ship for items worth more than 100 S
per CU. If they find any, roll 1d6, 1-2 they make notes and ask for a 1 CU
duty per CU of such goods, 3-6 they will take 1 CU of one such item (the most
valuable) and then let you pass. If you attempt to stop them, or refuse to pay
the duty, a fight breaks out on board, see <a href="#R327">R327</a>. If you win the fight on
board, you will then have to fight the Byzantine ship, see <a href="#E189">E189</a>.

## <a name="E174">E174 Approach Battle (takes 1 hour)</a>
You have wandered into a battle between Nipna and Mynkuria, and inadvertently
get involved. Roll 1d6:

You are approached by a palace sentry, who informs you that this part of the
palace is out-of-bounds to visitors. He begins to escort you from the palace.
If you agree to leave, you must immediately travel to any connecting land
area. Alternately, you can try to bribe him to pass you for 75 S base price.
If you succeed with a Cunning roll 0202) you are successful. If you fail he
sounds an alert and guards appear, see <a href="#E160">E160</a>.

## <a name="E176">E176 Flee the Life Force (takes normal travel time)</a>
Your party runs away, leaving behind any vehicles or robots, as well as
anything they cannot personally carry. You must immediately travel to any
connecting area. If you do not immediately return as your next activity,
everything left behind is lost. If you do return as your next activity, any
living or organic cargo is gone, including wood, papers, art works, fuel
units, etc., but not liquor or drugs. All other cargo is intact. Any vehicles
are undamaged but broken-down (<a href="#R218">R218</a>). Roll 1d6 for each robot left behind:

| D6  | Result                                     |
|-----|--------------------------------------------|

## <a name="E177">E177 Psionic Contact (takes no time)</a>
Your psionicist reports that the boat has three powerful and potentially
dangerous psionicists on board. They offer a deal that might interest you.
Details are unknown, since they have mental shields up. You may either leave
by sublight or hyperdrive travel (the boat is too slow to pursue), or you can
wait and let them dock — see <a href="#E169">E169</a>.

## <a name="E178">E178 Lost in Rough Terrain (takes rest of day)</a>
If you have a ship’s boat or starship, you can spend one hour to climb to
orbit, (<a href="#R214">R214</a> in boat, <a href="#R212">R212</a>G in starship). Otherwise, follow this result: You
have lost your way. At the end of the day, roll 1d6. A 1-3 result means you
determine your location at night by starlight, no further effect. A 4-6
results means you are unable to locate yourself, you are lost throughout
tomorrow (the day is wasted), then roil 1d6 again and use these same results
again.

## <a name="E179">E179 Attack the Merchant (takes 1 hour/round)</a>
The merchant ship will stand and fight, but will not pursue if you try to
escape. When the merchant has suffered eleven hits (is within one of
destruction) it will surrender and submit to boarding. You can board if you
have someone to leave behind to man the starship guns on your ship. Otherwise
you cannot board and the event ends. If you board, you discover you can loot
the merchant, but the captain and his loyal crew threaten self-destruct if you
do anything else. If you loot the ship you’ll be “wanted” in this system, roll
1d6 for the result:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |

|  2  | find 30 CU of platinum ore concentrate, worth 800 S base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) at any Industrial area |
|  3  | find 64 dead slaves — their life support failed during the battle, they are now worthless, but you won’t be “wanted” due to your piracy (slavers don’t complain to authorities!) |
|  4  | find six luxury skimmers, each 10 CU, you can sell one per City or Gambling area if you roll 1d6 and get 5-6 for a base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 400 S, each sales attempt takes 1 hour, no more than one attempt per day in an area |
|  5  | find 50 CU of luxury candies worth 200 S per CU at any palace, and a 2 CU unit of Vegan pomset oil (see below) |

intelligent forest-dweller under protection from exploitation. The oil is
illegal in every system of this sector, with a 30,000 S fine to anyone caught
with it by any authorities (plus confiscation of the oil). However, the oil
may be sold at a Space Station or Scientific area for a base price of 18,000 S
per CU.

foods at 10 S per CU. Exotic foods can be sold at a City or Colony for a base
price of 30 S per CU, or at a Palace or Space Station for a base price of 50 S
per CU. However, if not sold within 3 days, roll 1d6, a “6” indicates food has
spoiled. If not sold within 5 days, all the food spoils and becomes worthless.

## <a name="E181">E181 Union Roadblock (takes 1 hour)</a>
If you are entering in any vehicle other than commercial vehicles, you are
stopped by a force of 20 union men, each <a href="#E12">E12</a>, M2, H6 with sidearms (see <a href="#R210">R210</a>
for tech level). They have with them an all-terrain mover with a boat gun and
gunner (<a href="#E8">E8</a>, M5, H3). They inform you that you cannot enter the area unless you
hire commercial transport (<a href="#R215">R215</a>B), which they can call for you now. If you do,
and pay the appropriate cost, you enter normally. If you refuse, you either
cannot enter the area (and must go elsewhere), or you can try to shoot your
way past — see <a href="#R327">R327</a>. Once in battle, any escape from it becomes a successful
“running” through the roadblock.

## <a name="E182">E182 Answer Distress Call (takes 2 hours)</a>
You approach the starship and notice pieces of debris nearby. However as you
dock, both your airlock and main cargo hold doors are blown open, and two
groups of space pirates rush into your ship. Each pirate is <a href="#E8">E8</a>, M4, H6 in a

the airlock one man per turn, and through the cargo doors at 3 men per turn.
You can abandon ship to them via your ship’s boat, or you can fight within
your starship. If you defeat the pirates on your ship, you can turn about and
loot the pirate ship for 2d6 times 100 S in fittings and treasure. You must
then abandon it, as its engines are rapidly approaching the critical stage.

## <a name="E183">E183 Tortured by Mynkurians (times varies)</a>
Believing you to be a Nipnan spy, the Mynkurians begin to torture and question
you. You lose all your personal possessions permanently, and roll 1d6 for
the result:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |

and opens fire on your party with surprise, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>I. Each cultist is <a href="#E6">E6</a>, M2,
H2. If they disable your entire party, they will steal all of your party’s
possessions and leave you, including any vehicles except a ship’s boat or
starship (which they are unable to operate). Needle Guns: tech 3 weapon
similar to sidearm, but any hit results in automatic disablement of the target.

## <a name="E185">E185 Holdup Men (takes 1 hour)</a>
If you are travelling with two or more companions in your party, this result is
no encounter and no effect. Otherwise, you are accosted by two men who hold
you up, trying to take all your money and possessions. You can give it to
them, or fight. If you fight, see <a href="#R305">R305</a>. Each holdup man is <a href="#E7">E7</a>, M5, H5, one has

## <a name="E186">E186 Mental Shields Up (takes no time)</a>
Although the probes could not get specific information, the psionicist working
for the New Karman Defense Force learned your personal identity. You are now
“wanted” (<a href="#R228">R228</a>) in the New Karma system, whether or not you actually committed
any crimes, possess contraband, etc.!

| 5-6 | life force merges with you, adding its current Endurance points to your own (a permanent increase) and then becomes a wispy green cloud that dissipates with no further effect. |

## <a name="E188">E188 Anagathic Venom (takes 1 hour)</a>
You hear rumors of a rare arachnid that produces a venom that supposedly
arrests aging. Your contact claims to have 1d6 doses of it, for a base price
(<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 1,000 S per dose. If it is fresh and genuine, it may be resold in
any City or Palace for a base price of 10,000 S per dose.

If you buy some, you may have it analyzed at any scientific area for 25 S per
dose to determine if it is salable. Otherwise, roll 1d6 at the time of sale:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |

## <a name="E189">E189 Attack the Black Starship (takes 1 hour/round)</a>
The ship belongs to the Byzantine secret police. It has 12 hit points and tech
1 starship guns (one turret). It will continue to fight back and pursue until
it has more hits than you, then it will attempt to escape. You cannot capture
it, but you could destroy it by chasing it and inflicting all 12 hits. This
makes you “wanted” (<a href="#R228">R228</a>) at Byzantium. If you try to escape from it, see <a href="#E431">E431</a>.

companionship with you and your crew. Each day you spend here in RRR (<a href="#R203">R203</a>C)
with them you earn a base price of 10 S, but cannot do anything during the
day. You may stay as long as you wish. The crewmen will keep their own
earnings, and will remain available even if you stop paying a salary to them
(due to their earnings in this fashion). However, once you end the
arrangement, the crew require normal salaries again.

## <a name="E191">E191 Assassination Contract (takes rest of day)</a>
An underground contact offers you 500 S now and 5,000 S when you return to this
area after the job, if you will assassinate a certain person. Roll 1d6 for the

| 6   | Palatek corporate president, <a href="#E4">E4</a>, M0, H2, found in any area of Palatek with life support                        |

To find your target, roll 1d6 when you enter an area where he may be, “6”
indicates you find him by chance. Alternately, you can spend an entire day in
an area, with at least one hour during the day in active searching (the rest
can be doing whatever you desire, except RRR), and roll 1d6 at the end of the
day, “5” or “6” means you have found him. Once you find the target, roll 1d6
to determine exact situation and bodyguard. You must kill the target and
return to the area where you met the contact to get your 5,000 S final fee.
Situation die rolls are:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | he is alone wearing only a sidearm (see <a href="#R210">R210</a> for tech level, weapon is two levels above normal, up to a maximum of level 6) |
| 3-4 | he has two bodyguards                                                                                          |
|  5  | he has four bodyguards                                                                                         |
|  6  | he is in an armored limousine skimmer with driver and bodyguard manning skimmer guns The bodyguards are <a href="#E8">E8</a>, M5, H5 with sidearms one above normal tech level (see <a href="#R210">R210</a>) with a maximum of tech 6. Armored limousine skimmer will reduce all hits by two (i.e., a single or double hit does no damage, a triple hit does one hit of damage, etc.). The bodyguards will fight to the death, but the target will attempt to escape as soon as his side is hit more often (over all) than your side. If you have already assassinated the target, ignore this encounter. |

## <a name="E192">E192 Cargo Run to Palatek (takes rest of day)</a>
You have an offer to pick up quaint hand carved items at the Colony on Regari
for a base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 5 S per CU, and to sell them at the City on
Palatek for a base price of 10 S per CU. Then, at the city you can buy
electronics parts for a base price of 60 S per CU, and sell them at the Colony
on Regari for 100 S per CU, You may continue this loop-run for as long as you
wish, and carry whatever you can afford to buy and fit. Buying and selling,
with appropriate loading and unloading, at either the Colony or City takes one
hour (at each place).

## <a name="E193">E193 Answer Distress Call (takes 1 hour per die roll)</a>
When you reach the starship, you see extensive damage in its engineering
compartment, with gas all around. You decide to dock and send over a boarding
party. Decide who is in the party. Each must have a utility suit. Once the
party is inside, for each hour you spend aboard, roll 1d6 once. You can stay
and continue rolling until 2 hours past the normal end of the day, or until a
result prohibits further rolls. Rescue roll results are:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-3 | each person in the party saves one person on the damaged ship, then heavy explosions begin and it must be abandoned |
|  4  | corrosive fumes melt the suit of one in your boarding party (select him randomly), killing him, rest must abandon the damaged ship instantly |
|  5  | save two people in the crew quarters, may continue work next hour;                                             |
|  6  | you save one person, then a high voltage arc in a passageway kills one in the party (determine which one randomly, could be the person saved) Insurance Reward for the people saved from the ship will be 500 S per person base payment (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) when you land them on any planet. |

## <a name="E194">E194 Feed It Life Support Units (takes 1 hour)</a>
Pick a number of LSUs (<a href="#R213">R213</a>) to feed it. It will gain one Endurance point for
each LSU fed. Then roll 1d6: if the result is less than the number of LSUs
given, it turns into a misty cloud and dissipates. However, if the roll is “6”
instead it engulfs one person present (determine at random, see <a href="#E187">E187</a> if it
engulfs you) instead! If this happens, refer back to <a href="#E135">E135</a> again and select any
option there, including this one again if you wish.

## <a name="E195">E195 Attack the Mynkurians (takes 1 hour)</a>
You may fire twice before the ships reach you, see <a href="#R230">R230</a>L. They have neither ECM
nor defensive screens, and each hit destroys one ship. Any Mynkurian ships
that get past will collide with your ship, see <a href="#E165">E165</a>.

## <a name="E196">E196 Minor Eruption (takes 1 hour)</a>
You are caught in a minor eruption by a new volcano in this rugged area. If you
are in a vehicle, it takes one hit of damage (<a href="#R217">R217</a>), If on foot, suffer 1d6-1
hits to each person in the party (roll separately for each). You can avoid
personal injury if on foot through a successful Cunning roll (<a href="#R202">R202</a>).

## <a name="E197">E197 Allow Them to Board (takes rest of day)</a>
They board and escort you and your ship to a Palatek Space Station (or orbit,
if no station) at the nearest planet. They then search your ship (<a href="#R229">R229</a>D)
looking for any item from an Industrial or Scientific area. If they find such
an item, see <a href="#E021">E021</a>. If you had combat before allowing them to board, or any
prior encounters with Palatek ships, you are fined 400 S for each hit you
inflicted. If you are “wanted” they send you to jail — <a href="#E023">E023</a>. Otherwise, you
are passed on your way tomorrow with no problems.

## <a name="E198">E198 Disgruntled Colonists (takes rest of day)</a>
You are met by a group of colonists that hate their life here, and wish to go
to a Colony on any other planet in any system with a higher Wealth Code (if
none, then Rural or Mining areas instead). There are 1d6 times ten colonists
who wish to go, each pays you 30 S, but only on delivery to their new home.
Each colonist with his/her possessions takes up 2 CU. You can take as many as
you wish, but if you take less than half those present, roll 1d6, on “3” or
higher see <a href="#E142">E142</a>. If you take them all, see <a href="#E122">E122</a>, one of the colonists wants to
join your crew (if he does, he won’t pay the 30 S).

## <a name="E199">E199 Palace Statuary (takes 1 hour per theft)</a>
You have a chance to steal statuary from the gardens of the palace. Each statue
is 3 CU and is worth a base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 300 S on New Karma only. You can
return to this area for more statues, but each time you must roll 1d6 (instead
of normal Entry Encounter), unless the roll is greater than the number of
trips already made, you are discovered by the palace guards — see <a href="#E160">E160</a>.

Sections 200-399 are covered in the Rules booklet. Events continue with
paragraph 400.

## <a name="E400">E400 Space Amoeba (takes 1 hour)</a>
As the stasis unit is deactivated, you see a space amoeba in the act of
fission, forming two new amoebas, each of 2 CU size. Each immediately rushes
to engulf the nearest character (determine randomly), and combat ensues, see
<a href="#R230">R230</a>. In the first round of combat the amoeba is moving to contact and sending
tendrils into their victims, no wounds are suffered, but no suit will provide
protection either. Thereafter, each round the victim suffers one hit while the
amoeba gains one Endurance point. An amoeba cannot be injured in hand-to-hand
combat, and each hit from a ranged weapon also inflicts one hit on the
amoeba’s current victim. A successful hand-to-hand attack with dyla-weed or
hallucinogenic drugs will disable the amoeba for 1d6 rounds, during which time
it can be placed in a stasis unit (one CU needed per four Endurance points of
amoeba). Amoebas fresh from fission are Endurance 5, and when it grows to
Endurance 10 it will fission again into two Endurance 5 amoebas, with one or
both seeking new targets as necessary. A known amoeba in stasis can be sold at
any scientific area for 1,000 S per CU of amoeba.

## <a name="E401">E401 Mental Shield (takes 1 hour)</a>
You are protected from the mental attack, quickly engage the sublight drive,
and escape. When you check your psionicist, you discover he has collapsed and
suffered 2d6 hits. You have no idea what caused the attack; no ship appeared
on your scanners as you escaped!

## <a name="E402">E402 Gun Buoy Examined (takes rest of day)</a>
You examine the damaged gun buoy for anything of value, roll 1d6:


| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-3 | buoy reduced to scrap, nothing of value                                                                        |
| 4   | you can take its tech 6 guns for yourself if you have a starship engineer present to dismantle them            |
| 5-6 | you retrieve a robot brain that has a combat program (M6, H1, can fire any type of weapon) and is broken down (<a href="#R218">R218</a>). The brain unit is 1 CU and doubles the operating expense of any normal robot. It can be installed in any normal robot by a Starship Engineer, and if installed, allows the robot to respond to commands and fight until death in combat with whatever weapons the robot is given. The robot can be used to operate starship guns too. Combat capable robots are illegal in every system of the Pavonis sector. |

## <a name="E403">E403 Boarding Party (takes 1 hour)</a>
You are instructed to pay 80 S for pilot fees, 10 S visa charge for each person
on board, and a 25 S entry permit fee for the starship. There is no choice but
to pay, since they have overpowering force around and on board. However, if
you or anyone else on board is “wanted” here (<a href="#R228">R228</a>) they seem unaware of it.
If you are unable or unwilling to pay you must hyperjump (<a href="#R212">R212</a>A) out of the
system, or have your starship impounded upon landing until you can pay the
fees, plus 10% interest per day.

## <a name="E404">E404 Try to Energize Stasis (time varies)</a>
You reach toward the stasis control and energize it just as the mutinous
crewman fires his weapon. Unfortunately for the crewman, he is partly in the
stasis field, and is killed instantly. The ship cannot be operated with the
stasis unit in the pilot’s pod energized, so the remaining crewmen on board
depart with the ship’s boat and as much valuable cargo as they can fit into
it. The rest remains intact until your recovery from stasis (see <a href="#R240">R240</a>). At the
instant the stasis field drops the crewman’s shot finishes, and you must
determine what effect it had on you (see <a href="#R230">R230</a>).

## <a name="E405">E405 Four Armed Men (takes 1 hour)</a>
You surprise four armed men, who appear startled after the stasis unit is
de-energized. Each is <a href="#E6">E6</a>, M4, H1 with a tech 5 sidearm. You may attack first
with surprise (<a href="#R230">R230</a>I) or try to talk with them. If you talk, roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                          |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | they put down weapons but will not work for you, encounter ends |
| 3   | they will work as bodyguards, at 5 S per week each              |
| 4-6 | they open fire, see <a href="#R327">R327</a>                                        |

## <a name="E406">E406 Offer Bribe (takes no time)</a>
Roll 1d6 for the result of your bribe:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | they accept it and let you pass                                            |
| 2   | they demand triple what you offered, and will let you pass if you pay it   |
| 3   | they demand 1d6 times 1,000 S for a bribe, will let you pass if you pay it |
| 4-6 | they refuse your bribe                                                     |

If you cannot bribe them, they open fire, see <a href="#E428">E428</a>.

## <a name="E407">E407 Shoot at Object on Hull (takes 1 hour)</a>
You fire at it: intense radiation is reflected back. It inflicts 1d6+2
hits (<a href="#R231">R231</a>) on each person outside the hull of your starship, even if within a
ship’s boat or utility suit. The object appears unaffected. Return to <a href="#E119">E119</a> and
select another option.

## <a name="E408">E408 Ship Darts Away (takes 1 hour)</a>
As you first contact the hull of the strange ship, it suddenly withdraws a
short distance, extends three projections, and rapidly accelerates away. Your
scanners quickly lose it, and it is far too fast to pursue. Encounter ends.

## <a name="E409">E409 Religious Fanatics (takes rest of day)</a>
You meet the spokesman of an unusual religious cult on New Karma. He wishes to
arrange passage for their missionaries, one person to every other system in
the sector. You pick up the nine missionaries at a New Karma spaceport (or
colony) and deliver each to any rural area or city at the destination. You are
paid 2,500 S from a local bank at the time of each delivery. Since the cult
believes in the daily sacrifice of domestic animals, you must carry 1 CU of
animals for each day any missionary is aboard. The missionaries will provide
the animals in whatever quantity you request, but will deduct 100 S from the
total paid for each extra animal requested but not actually used during
travel. If a day occurs in which a sacrifice is not performed (due to a lack
of animals) all remaining missionaries on board commit suicide and no more
payments are possible.

## <a name="E410">E410 Rich Member of Royal Family (takes 1 hour)</a>
When the stasis unit is de-energized, there is a grossly fat (2 CU) man
standing there. He identifies himself as Johann, subprince of the royal family
of Imperia. If you will return him to an Imperian land area immediately (by
the shortest possible route he will pay you 100,000 S. For each day after
tomorrow that he arrives there, the fee is reduced 10,000 S. If you do not
return him within 10 days, you automatically become “wanted” on Imperia (he
becomes angry and gets revenge in this fashion!).

## <a name="E411">E411 Gunner Fires (takes no time)</a>
Your gunner sees a small, torpedo-shaped vessel very close to your ship. He,
fires and hits easily, doing great damage. He doesn't fire a second round
because a mental surge caused 1d6 hits and knocked him unconscious. You are no
longer under mental attack, and nobody else reports any probes or attacks. You
may leave, or send one person in a utility suit to crawl into the broken end
of the torpedo-shaped craft. If someone enters, see <a href="#E419">E419</a>.

## <a name="E412">E412 Go with Mutineer (takes 1 hour)</a>
The mutinous crewman disarms you and any of your bodyguards, and escorts you to
the ship’s boat. You are permitted to load the boat with any cargo except
weapons and depart the ship. As soon as you leave, the starship engages its
sublight drive and quickly heads toward planet fall, apparently with your
crewman as pilot/navigator. If you reach the same planet yourself, you may
search for your starship. Each time you enter a land area that could contain
it, spend one hour and roll 1d6, on a 1-4 you can’t find it, on 5-6 you do
find it, stripped of all guns, cargo, stasis units, RUs, FUs, and LSUs. You
cannot check an area more than once. If you check them all without finding the
ship, it is gone forever. You will never again encounter the mutinous crewman.

## <a name="E413">E413 Try to Escape Scout (takes 1 hour)</a>
As you try to escape, the scout fires once with each gun, hitting with each.
The standard guns inflict one hit (<a href="#R217">R217</a>) on the starship. The unusual nose gun
fires a magneto-plasma that penetrates the hull without doing any physical
damage. However, induced neural currents kill all individuals in one
compartment, determined by a 1d6 roll:

| D6  | Result                             |
|-----|------------------------------------|
| 1   | pilot’s compartment                |
| 2   | crew quarters                      |
| 3   | engineering                        |
| 4   | gun turret                         |
| 5   | main cargo hold                    |
| 6   | boat hold and ship’s boat. Your starship then successfully escapes the scout, which does not pursue. |

The encounter ends.

## <a name="E414">E414 Engineer Examines Object on Hull (takes 2 hours)</a>
Your engineer tries to puzzle out the device, roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | he touches the wrong thing, is bathed in intense radiation, suffers 2d6 hits — return to <a href="#E119">E119</a> and select another option |
| 2   | he touches the wrong thing and it explodes, killing him and inflicting two hits on the starship, as well as destroying everything in the compartment or area to which it is attached |
| 3   | he is unable to understand the device, but does get if off the hull, you proceed without further incident      |
| 4   | he removes two servo-controllers of advanced design, each can be sold at a scientific or industrial area, in a system other than this, for 2,200 S base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) each; the object is now inoperative, and he removes it |
| 5   | it appears to be a self-propelled mine with 3 CU of explosives; he works the explosives loose, each is worth 300 S base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) at any mining area, the rest of the device is unusable and he removes it |
| 6   | he discovers it is a small, controllable craft with sublight drives (<a href="#R212">R212</a>F) that has a one-year power unit and life support. It has 3 CU internal space, and takes up 9 CU area. There is no way to mount guns upon it. It originally had 3 CU of explosives (see “5” above) in it, but the engineer removes these |

## <a name="E415">E415 Wounded Pilot/Navigator (takes 1 hour)</a>
The stasis unit contains a starship pilot/navigator (<a href="#R221">R221</a>A) with <a href="#E7">E7</a>, M0, H2 and
1d6 wounds. In return for rescuing him, he will work without pay for. you for
the next 40 days. If you don’t want his services, he will pay you by replacing
the stasis unit you used to free him with one of equal size whenever you next
arrive at a spaceport or space station.

## <a name="E416">E416 Ship Self-Destructs (instantly)</a>
The ship suddenly erupts in a massive explosion, destroying you, you crew, and
your own starship. The game, is over, you lose.

## <a name="E417">E417 Escapee Seeks Help (takes 1 hour)</a>
You are contacted by a person who has just escaped from the prisons of this
system. He pleads with you to take him off planet before the end of the next
day, and to deliver him to his own planet. Roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                             |
|-----|------------------------------------|
| 1   | Palatek                            |
| 2   | Uruskop                            |
| 3   | Byzantium                          |

| 5   | Mynkuria                           |
| 6   | New Karma                          |

He promises a rich reward if you get him there. He is emaciated and sickly,
unable to fight or perform any other task. You may ignore him, turn him into
the authorities (if you are not “wanted” here) for a 10 S reward, or take him
along. If you decide to take him, see <a href="#E427">E427</a> when you deliver him to any area at
his destination which has life support.

## <a name="E418">E418 Sub light Drive Energized (takes 1 hour)</a>
When you energize the sublight drive, roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | the object is dislodged and lost in space                                                                      |
| 3-5 | the object emits intense penetration radiation that kills all life in the compartment or area against which it is attached, while the object itself melts onto the hull and becomes worthless junk |
| 6   | the object apparently is unaffected and unchanged, return to <a href="#E119">E119</a> or select another option once you turn off the sublight drive |


## <a name="E419">E419 Investigate Torpedo (takes 1d6 hours)</a>
Roll 1d6 to see what is found inside:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | interior is completely torn apart and unrecognizable, nothing of any value remains                             |
| 2   | an apparently deformed person, now dead, is present, the remains are worth 100 S if brought to any Scientific area for examination |
| 3-6 | an unconscious person in a utility suit is amid the battered interior. The person is wearing a beautiful glowing gem hanging on a chain around the neck, outside the suit. Out of curiosity, the gem is removed. The person goes into instant convulsions and dies, and the gem is returned to your ship. It is worth 20,000 S base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) at any Mining area, or you can put it on and see what happens. If that occurs, roll 1d6 for the result: |


| D6  | Result                                                                 |

| 3-5 | person immediately gains 1d6+2 in psionic power (see <a href="#E022">E022</a>), but if the gem is ever removed from the person he or she will instantly die                                                                        |
| 6   | person gains overwhelming psionic power; if the person is you, you win the game once you return to any planet (since you can directly control the behavior of anyone), if the person is someone else, you lose the game, as he or she enslaves you mentally.                                                         |

## <a name="E420">E420 Starship Engineer (takes 1d6 hours)</a>
When the stasis unit is de-energized, you discover a starship engineer in a
utility suit, with tools, equipment, and a tech-1 utility robot (<a href="#R222">R222</a>). After
considerable questioning, you discover that he was in a starship that must
have been destroyed 84 years ago. All his friends and relatives are gone. He
claims the robot is his, and wants to be set down on any planet with good air.
He will work for you instead if you buy the robot for 100 S and pay him 12 S
per week with a stasis unit at his work station (<a href="#R212">R212</a>E). He is <a href="#E8">E8</a>, M3, H3 and
a skimmer driver.

## <a name="E421">E421 Stasis Energized (takes rest of day)</a>
Once the stasis is energized, you are safe from mental attack, and no one else
is attacked. Your crew radios for help, another ship comes out to yours, tows
you to the nearest space station (or orbit around a planet, if no stations
exist in this system), removes your energized stasis unit, deenergizes it
(destroying it in the process, see <a href="#R212">R212</a>E), and replacing minor fixtures. The
overall charges for the entire service are 450 S. If you can’t pay, they
impound your starship until you do.

## <a name="E422">E422 Attack the Scout (takes 1 hour/round)</a>
You fire first, then the scout returns fire. After that, a space battle
continues (<a href="#R230">R230</a>L) until one ship is destroyed or escapes. If you attempt to
escape the scout will pursue. Scoutship data: two hits will destroy the scout
ship. It carries standard tech 6 starship guns (one turret) and a
magneto-plasma nose gun that fires once on the first turn and must recharge.
Each following turn roll 1d6, on a 5 or 6 it is recharged and fires again. The
magneto-plasma gun always hits, but does no physical damage. Instead, it
penetrates into one compartment and kills everyone inside by induced neural
current. Roll 1d6 for each hit to see which compartment suffers:

| D6  | Result                             |
|-----|------------------------------------|
| 1   | pilot’s compartment                |
| 2   | crew’s quarters                    |
| 3   | engineering compartment            |
| 4   | gun turret                         |
| 5   | main cargo hold                    |
| 6   | boat hold and the ship’s boat      |

## <a name="E423">E423 Attempt to Hyperjump (instantly)</a>
If the object was located above the hypercharge storage area it explodes and
destroys the starship. Any stasis units (<a href="#R212">R212</a>E) that automatically energize do
so, and remain in this star system. If the object was anyplace else, roll 1d6,
on a “1” it destroys the whole ship and kills you, on any other result it is
gone when you emerge from hyperspace — you’re none the wiser!

## <a name="E424">E424 Space Gypsies (takes rest of day)</a>
You are approached by the clan leader for some space gypsies. They need
transportation to New Karma. To show his good will, he gives you a fantastic
ruby, worth 480 S to a gem dealer, half that to anyone else. If you transport
the clan, he will give you another ruby of equal value for each person in the
clan — and there are 110 in the clan! The only condition is that they must all
travel together and arrive in New Karma in good condition. If you refuse, he
will leave, and you keep the ruby. If you agree, you must provide sufficient
space on board. When you reach New Karma with them, see <a href="#E020">E020</a>.

## <a name="E425">E425 Pure Dyla-Weed (takes no time)</a>
The stasis unit contains 4 CU of pure dyla-weed, an illegal hallucinogenic drug
worth a fortune anywhere in the sector. You can sell it in any Slum area for a
base price (<a href="#R229">R229</a>A) of 16,000 S per CU, but cannot sell any more than one CU in
any one Slum area.

## <a name="E426">E426 Enter Strange Ship (takes 1 hour)</a>
You discover the ship is made principally of the new bio-plastic alloys, and
that there are no crewmen left alive in it. With further investigation, you
realize the ship is actually alive! The walls of the corridor close in on you
as you fight to escape. Roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | you burst free and get back to your own ship; the living ship darts away and is rapidly lost to your scanners  |
| 3-4 | you are digested by the ship and are now no better than fuel (too bad)                                         |
| 5-6 | you are incorporated into the nervous system of the ship and retain your mental processes, although your body is destroyed. You can never escape or leave the starship, but consider this a victory anyway — crack open your old starship and have your first meal!                                                         |

## <a name="E427">E427 Escapee Delivered to Home World (takes 1 hour)</a>
Now you discover if the escapee could fulfill his promise. Roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | he slips away in a crowd, you never see him again, tough luck                                                  |
| 3   | he admits to having no wealth, but offers you 40 S, all he has!                                                |
| 4   | he has no money, but valuable underworld connections; he will provide you with a complete set of false papers (<a href="#R228">R228</a>) for you, your starship, and any members of your crew, as you wish                   |
| 5   | he thanks you and pays you 1,500 S                                                                             |
| 6   | he is from an incredibly wealth family and had been a political prisoner unable to return home. He pays you 4,000 S now and additional 4,000 S each week for the rest of your life. However, these payments are to a local bank account, and you cannot get advances on them. Payments continue until you are proven dead to the bank                                                                          |

## <a name="E428">E428 Scout Acts First (takes 2 hours)</a>
After waiting an hour the scout finally acts. Roll 1d6:

| D6  | Result                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | he gives a friendly warning and disappears rapidly                                                             |
| 3-6 | he opens fire. If he opens fire you can either return fire or instantly escape (if still able). For the effect of his fire, and resolving any space battles (in case you decide not to escape right now) see <a href="#E422">E422</a>             |

## <a name="E429">E429 Try to Open without an Engineer (takes 1d6 hours)</a>
Refer to <a href="#E414">E414</a> but subtract die roll there by one (-1). A result of “0” is
considered a “1” instead.

## <a name="E430">E430 Board the Ship (takes 3 hours)</a>
Upon boarding, you realize the ship is actually an Antelope class trader just
like your own, but with external camouflage. Inside the ship is in perfect
order but empty of all cargo, unarmed, and with a dead man in the pilot’s
couch. It has no hyperdrive charges left, and the engines require repair
before they will function (<a href="#R219">R219</a>) — a starship engineer (<a href="#R221">R221</a>B) is needed for
repairs. If you tow the ship to a space station or spaceport in this system
(travel at half speed while towing) you can realize 12,000 S in salvage rights
if the ship is unrepaired, 30,000 S resale if repaired. Selling the ship in
either case will take an entire day. Alternately, you can leave the ship
behind. If you do, someone else will surely find it before you can return and
claim it.

## <a name="E431">E431 Black Ship Astern (takes 1 hour)</a>
The ship fires one last shot and lets you go without pursuit.
